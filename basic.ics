DESCRIPTION:As the Dust Settles: using time-domain observations to reveal c
 loud structure in substellar atmospheres\n\nThe combination of condensate c
 louds and rapid rotation has long motivated searches for weather phenomena 
 in ultracool (late-M\, L and T) dwarf (UCD) atmospheres.  Pioneering work i
 n this field dating back as early as 1999 suggested that variability is qui
 te common for UCDs.  Yet these early studies were ambiguous:  detections we
 re often low-amplitude and/or lacking periodicity\, and the mechanisms resp
 onsible remained unclear.  Observations made in the past 5 years\, utilizin
 g continuous monitoring strategies\, better instruments\, and larger telesc
 opes have demonstrated conclusive and surprisingly large near-infrared vari
 ability for a subset of brown dwarfs at the transition between L and T spec
 tral types\, suggesting a patchy distribution of silicate clouds in their a
 tmospheres.  Brightness variations as large as 25% on readily observable ro
 tational timescales allow light curves of exquisite precision\, worthy of d
 etailed analysis\, to be obtained from both ground and space based faciliti
 es.  While the L/T transition is the realm of spectacular variability\, rec
 ent space-based efforts have confirmed lower levels of variability for a su
 bstantial fraction of UCDs at all spectral types.  I will describe how such
  multi-wavelength\, multi-epoch observations are contributing to an emergin
 g picture of cloud structure in brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Stellar Resonant Absorption of Gravitational Waves\nAbst
 ract: Massive binaries are expected to produce gravitational waves (GW) ove
 r a range of frequencies.  Some of these will coincide with the natural fre
 quencies of stellar oscillations\, allowing resonant driving of stellar osc
 illations by GW. Stars (including the Sun) can occult and dim (up to O(10%)
 ) GW sources by absorbing some of the GW energy\; stars near supermassive b
 lack hole binaries (SMBHB) should also absorb significant energy from GWs\,
  which may be re-radiated as electromagnetic energy. The exact opacity of s
 tars to GWs depends on the details of stellar structure. I will also discus
 s some expected electromagnetic signatures of massive black hole binaries i
 n galactic nuclei (including intermediate mass black hole-supermassive blac
 k hole binaries). Some of these will be electromagnetic 'advanced warning' 
 systems for GW detectors.

DESCRIPTION:The initial conditions of star formation in a turbulent interst
 ellar medium.\n\nAbstract: What controls the star formation rate in our gal
 axy and in other galaxies remains an unsolved question. The majority of the
  stars formed in the galaxy occur in a clustered fashion inside dense molec
 ular clouds. Understanding how these molecular clouds form\, evolve and col
 lapse under their own gravity is necessary for understanding the star forma
 tion rate of the galaxy. We use numerical simulations to study the dynamica
 l evolution of the self-gravitating\, magnetized\, turbulent ISM in a verti
 cal column of a disk galaxy. Turbulence\, driven by supernovae (SN) and sup
 erbubble (SB) explosions\, may provide the velocity dispersion required to 
 support the disk from collapsing. SN explosions also drive the galactic fou
 ntain\, where gas blown to high altitudes cools and falls back to the midpl
 ane. Most of the gas mass is observed to be concentrated around the galacti
 c midplane (|z| < 50pc) in the form of cold\, dense clouds. When these dens
 e structures become self-gravitating\, they quickly begin to collapse and f
 ragment\, following the background structure left by the turbulence. Rich f
 ilamentary structure and sub-structure is observed throughout the midplane 
 providing the initial conditions for star formation\, with morphology simil
 ar to that observed in infra red dark clouds. We show that star forming clo
 uds are strongly affected by the environment in which they form due to gas 
 accretion and mergers with other clouds.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Is the stellar initial mass function a probability dens
 ity distribution function?\, and how to make a galaxy's stellar population\
 n\nAbstact: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is usually assumed to b
 e a probability density distribution function. Recent data appear to rule o
 ut this interpretation though\, and I will discuss alternative more realist
 ic applications and results concerning the possibly true nature of the IMF.
  Empirical evidence has emerged that the IMF becomes top-heavy in intense s
 tar bursts and at low metallicity. Related to the IMF are binary star distr
 ibution functions\, and these evolve through dynamical processes in embedde
 d star clusters. The insights gained from these considerations lead to a ma
 thematically computable method for calculating stellar populations in galax
 ies\, with possibly important implications for the matter cycle in galaxies
 . It turns out that the galaxy-wide IMF\, the IGIMF\, becomes increasingly 
 top-heavy with increasing galaxy-wide star formation rate\, while at the sa
 me time the binary fraction in the galactic field decreases.

  a large\, diverse sample of low mass objects. However\, spectral energy di
 stributions (SED) with optical through mid-infrared data allow detailed spe
 ctroscopic study of the substellar regime over a broad wavelength baseline 
 as well as estimates of bulk properties via direct measurement of bolometri
 c flux. I construct nearly complete SEDs for a sample of 192 ultracool dwar
 fs across Teff of 600-3200K for both field age (>500 Myr) and young (10-150
  Myr) objects. I use parallaxes and kinematic distances to determine precis
 e bolometric luminosities and then use radii estimates from evolutionary mo
 dels to calculate Teff for the full sample of late-M\, L and T dwarfs. With
  these results I derive new age-sensitive temperature/ spectral type relati
 onships and bolometric corrections for the entire sequence\, and characteri
 ze the redistribution of flux from the near- to mid-infrared wavelength ran
 ges in the atmospheres of young L dwarfs. Finally\, I propose a future cour
 se of work to compare these results to fundamental parameters obtained by f
 itting model atmospheres to this unprecedented sample of SEDs. A robust fit
 ting routine that accounts for over 97% of the flux of any object in such a
  large\, age-calibrated sequence will improve identification and characteri
 zation of ultracool dwarfs and be a valuable test for future suites of mode
 ls. I will also attempt to identify and characterize more young T dwarfs in
  order to extend my analysis well into the planetary regime. I will then be
  in a unique position to disentangle the effects of Teff\, age and mass on 
 emergent flux and test formation and evolution theories of substellar objec
 ts.

DESCRIPTION:Slow Loris Conservation in Vietnam: integrating Evolutionary Bi
 ology\, Anthropology\, and Economics to Address a Complex Problem. \n\nThe 
 Center for Biodiversity and Conservation at AMNH has engaged in scientific 
 research to inform biodiversity conservation in Vietnam since 1997\, result

 d a new project in Vietnam to inform and improve the management of the illi
 cit wildlife trade\, which continues at high levels despite increased effor
 ts to control illegal activities. Trade management policies based on biolog
 ical research alone cannot address the socioeconomic context and drivers of
  wildlife trade. Dr. Blair is advancing interdisciplinary research to infor
 m more effective wildlife trade management by integrating biological\, anth
 ropological\, and socioeconomic data\, focusing on a particular group of en
 dangered primates for which exploitation from wildlife trade is its greates
 t threat: the nocturnal and elusive slow lorises. With support from the Nat
 ional Science Foundation\, her team is currently surveying across Vietnam f
 or slow loris population status in the wild (http://www.amnh.org/explore/ne
 ws-blogs/(tag)/6871)\, and uses genetics and morphological analyses to iden
 tify the species and geographic origins of slow lorises found in the trade.
  Also\, based on interviews with hunters\, sellers\, and consumers of wildl
 ife\, Dr. Blair will build an econometric model of wildlife trade in Vietna
 m that incorporates variation across scales\, improving our understanding o
 f the complex drivers of wildlife trade in this important region.\n\nAnd he
 reâs a bio for me if that is useful:\nDr. Mary E. Blair is the Assistant Di
 rector for Research and Strategic Planning at the Center for Biodiversity a

  research integrates molecular techniques with geographic information syste

 odiversity and the influence of environmental variability on evolutionary d
 ivergence. She also explores how knowledge of evolutionary processes can in
 form conservation planning and the spatial prioritization of conservation a

DESCRIPTION:Constraining the CV evolution with SW Sex stars and old novae\n
 \nFrom a large observing campaign\, we find that nearly all non- or weakly 
 magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) in the orbital period range between 2.
 8 and 4 hours are of SW Sex sub-type and as such experience very high mass 
 transfer rates. As the evolution of CVs is driven by angular momentum loss 
 which results in a decrease of the orbital period\, all long-period CVs nee
 d to cross this SW Sex regime of the orbital period distribution before ent
 ering the period gap. This makes the SW Sex phenomenon an evolutionary phas
 e in the life of a cataclysmic variable.\n\nOn the other hand\, some old no
 vae in this period range which are expected to show high mass transfer rate
  instead resemble low-mass transfer systems like dwarf novae. I will discus
 s them as candidates for so-called hibernating systems\, CVs that changed t
 heir mass transfer behaviour due to a previously experienced nova outburst.

DESCRIPTION:Imaging Planets and Disks with an Eye on the Future\n\nWe are p
 robably still decades away from being able to directly image an Earth-like 
 planet around another star. However\, with each passing year\, we make sign
 ificant advances towards achieving this goal. Young gas giant planets can n
 ow be directly imaged\, giving us clues to their atmospheric compositionsât
 he kind of information we will one day seek for Earth 2.0. In the meantime\
 , several other questions need to be answered: What do other planetary syst
 ems look like? What is the connection between planets and debris disks? Do 
 the ingredients necessary for life exist around other stars? \n\nIn this ta
 lk\, I will present research results on four different topics related to an
 swering these questions. First\, I will discuss my work on radial velocity 
 (RV) eccentricity bias. For years astronomers have been puzzled about the l
 arge number of RV-detected planets that have eccentric orbits (e > 0.1). I 
 will show that this problem can be partially explained when two circular-or
 bit planets masquerade as a single planet on an eccentric orbit. I use this
  finding to predict that planets with mildly eccentric orbits are the most 
 likely to have massive companions on wide orbits\, potentially detectable b
 y future direct imaging observations. Second\, I will present direct imagin
 g results on an old RV planetary systemâan attempt at combining two powerfu
 l planet detection techniques that will one day be crucial for determining 
 the true mass distribution of extrasolar planets. I will also discuss a new
  program I am leading to image long-period companions with MagAO. Third\, I
  will present direct imaging results on several bright debris disks (includ
 ing a brand new one) in the visible and near-infrared using the LBT and Mag
 AO. Imaging at these wavelengths is a window into the composition of the du
 st grains scattering the star light\, allowing us to determine how much (if
  any) water ice and/or organic materials are present. Finally\, I will pres
 ent my bold foray into theory to understand and characterize the observatio
 nal signatures planets dynamically leave on debris disks. I will show how b
 igger planets create broader disks\, meaning we can use debris disk widths 
 to estimate an interior shepherding planet's mass. This will prove especial
 ly useful to planet imagers in the coming years for both searching for and 
 characterizing new disk-shepherding planets.\n

DESCRIPTION:"Microlensing: Beyond Planet Detection"\n\nMicrolensing uses th
 e gravitational bending of light to detect exoplanets. Because the typical 
 timescale of the events is ~20 days and the individual events are not repea
 ted\, microlensing is generally thought of as giving only an instantaneous 
 snapshot of the planetary system. In the context of recent microlensing dis
 coveries\, I will show how additional data and the inclusion of higher orde
 r effects in the analysis enables us to more fully characterize these plane
 tary systems. These techniques expand the scope of microlensing beyond plan
 et detection and toward a better understanding of brown dwarfs\, stellar re

DESCRIPTION:How asteroids break apart due to fast rotation? A consequence o
 f their 'rubble-pile' structure\n \nA newly exciting discovered category of
  asteroid pairs consists of asteroids that share very similar orbital eleme
 nts but are gravitationally unbound (Vokrouhlicky & Nesvorny 2008). Studies
  have shown that these pairs are fragments of strength-less asteroids\, cal
 led ârubble-pilesâ\, that failed to remain bound against an increasing rota
 tion rate. Since these disintegration events are dated to the last 10^6 yea
 rs they serve as a unique\, almost âliveâ experiments for asteroid evolutio
 n\, and can teach us about the internal structure of asteroids and about th
 eir evolution.\n \nWe perform a spectroscopic and photometric survey of ast
 eroid pairs that search for correlations between age-related mechanisms tha
 t modify the spectra (e.g.\, space weathering) to other parameters such as 
 dynamical age\, size and shape. The observations allow us to confirm a theo
 retical model of rotational-disruption (Jacobson & Scheeres 2011) in which 
 the ejected component itself disintegrates due to continuous torques and ti
 dal forces applied by the main body. This mechanism can result with the exp
 osure of significant amount of âfreshâ\, non-weathered material from below 
 the surface. This is indeed found by our survey that located the first âfre
 shâ main-belt asteroids observed over the full visible and near-infrared ra
 nge.\n \nThe study was published in: Polishook et al.\, 2014. Observations 
 of âfreshâ and weathered surfaces on asteroid pairs and their implications

DESCRIPTION:Solving CDM's Small Scale Crisis with Baryons\n\nThe cosmologic
 al model based on cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy has been hugely su
 ccessful in describing the observed evolution and large scale structure of 
 our Universe.  However\, at small scales (in the smallest galaxies and at t
 he centers of larger galaxies)\, a number of observations seem to conflict 
 with the predictions CDM cosmology\, leading to recent exploration of Warm 
 Dark Matter (WDM) and Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) models. These sma

 x physics of baryons make them more difficult to model. I will show results
  from high resolution cosmological galaxy simulations that include both bar
 yons and dark matter to show that baryonic physics can significantly alter 
 the dark matter structure and substructure of galaxies\, revolutionizing ou
 r expectations for galaxy structure within CDM.\n

DESCRIPTION:The Quest for Dark Matter\n\nAstrophysical and cosmological obs
 ervations provide compelling evidence that about 85% of all the matter in t
 he Universe is in the form of Dark Matter\, an elusive substance which is c
 urrently searched for with a variety of experimental strategies. In my talk
 \, I will argue that we may be about to witness a pivotal paradigm shift in
  physics\, as we set out to test the existence of some of the most promisin
 g dark matter candidates with a wide array of experiments\, including the L
 arge Hadron Collider at CERN and a new generation of astroparticle experime
 nts underground and in space.

DESCRIPTION:Dating middle-aged stars\n\nWe have recently demonstrated that 
 Ruprecht 147 (NGC 6774) is the oldest nearby open cluster\, with an age of 
 3 Gyr at 300 pc\, which allows it to serve as a sorely needed intermediate-
 aged benchmark. Stellar ages are difficult to infer for main sequence stars
 \, but age can reveal itself through the spin down of stars via magnetic br
 aking\, which also causes magnetic activity to wane with time. I will discu
 ss our efforts to characterize this cluster and determine its membership\, 
 what we have learned so far about magnetic activity at 3 Gyr\, and will out
 line our projects underway targeting the low-mass stars\, white dwarf\, and
  blue straggler populations\, Lithium depletion\, and exoplanet searches in
  this cluster environment. For more information\, see Curtis et al. (2013)\

DESCRIPTION:Title:\nObserving the Origins of Galaxy Structure in Simulation
 s\n\nAbstract:\nIt remains debated whether galaxy mergers\, gas flows\, or 
 internal processes shape the population of galaxies we see today.  I will d
 escribe work to disentangle these issues using mock data derived from hydro
 dynamical simulations of galaxy formation.  First\, I use model IR and opti
 cal spectra to diagnose galaxy mergers\, showing that the number of post-st
 arburst galaxies is consistent  with independent estimates of the galaxy me
 rger rate.  This owes to an underappreciated fact: not all major mergers ar
 e likely to produce a major starburst. \nPrimarily\, I will describe how we
  study galaxy morphology by building "mock observatories" around cosmologic
 al simulations.  With these\, we address how the common galaxy shapes emerg
 ed and how they relate to cessation of star formation in the universe.  Ear
 ly results suggest realistic populations of galaxy disks and bulges are a n
 atural consequence of galaxy formation models with black hole and star form
 ation feedback set to reproduce global quantities.  Such simulations make r
 eadily falsifiable predictions that can be pressured by future surveys\, an
 d I will describe how we use these mock data to create diagnostics of galax
 y dynamics.

DESCRIPTION:"Hot rocky to gas planets: How host stars and realistic UV flux
  change the detectable features for Mini-Neptunes and rocky atmospheres"\n\
 nRecent ground and space surveys resulted in the detection of many hot extr
 asolar planets. These planets are interesting targets for current and futur
 e observations\, therefore\, addressing their atmospheric structure and com
 position is a major issue and the aim of my work. For the hot potentially r
 ocky exoplanets with an outgassed atmosphere we developed a simple approach
  to find their atmospheric composition according to their observable data (
 radius\, semi-major axis and stellar effective temperature). For hot mini-N
 eptune and giant planets's atmospheres\, we calculated an atmospheric grid 
 that links astrophysical observable parameters - orbital distance and stell
 ar type - with the atmospheric species expected in exoplanet atmospheres. W
 e link a 1D code that calculates the atmospheric thermal structure with a p
 hotochemical model that includes disequilibrium chemistry and explore the e
 ffect of empirical model parameters on the results\, for planets around a w
 ide range of stellar types from F to M\, including the effect of high FUV r
 adiation on their atmospheres. Our results can be applied to current and fu
 ture observations to characterize exoplanet atmospheres and serves as a ref
 erence to interpret atmospheric retrieval analysis results.

DESCRIPTION:New Views of the Solar System with NEOWISE\n\nThe orbital and p
 hysical properties of asteroids and comets serve as markers of the major ev
 ents that occurred in our solar system. The continued interaction between t
 hese bodies and our planet also drives forward efforts to better under them
 . Yet of the nearly 600\,000 asteroids that have been discovered to date\, 
 only several thousand had any sort of\nphysical measurements made of them b
 eyond brightness and orbital properties until the advent of the Wide-field 
 Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This mission observed the entire sky at fo
 ur infrared wavelengths\, 3.4\, 4.6\, 12 and 22 microns. Although its origi
 nal goals\nwere to study ultraluminous infrared galaxies and cool brown dwa
 rfs\, enhancements to the science data processing pipeline have resulted in
  robust diameter measurements for >158\,000 minor planets. Radiometric tech
 niques allow for the study of sizes\, albedos\, thermal inertia\, and light
 curves for large numbers of asteroids. Dust temperatures\, production rates
 \, particle size distributions\, and CO/CO2 abundances can be derived\nfor 
 comets. The mission\, now renamed NEOWISE\, has recently been restarted\nto
  continue characterizing asteroids and comets.

DESCRIPTION:title: Measuring the mass of the Milky Way using Tidal Streams 
 of Globular Clusters\n\nAbstract: The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular cl
 usters which continuously lose mass into the Galactic tidal field. In addit
 ion\, a largely unknown number of already dissolved globular clusters shoul
 d have deposited their stars into the halo of the Milky Way. In large-scale
  surveys these dissolution product show up as coherent structures tracing t

 r the Galactic potential and reconstruct the effects of two-body relaxation
  and tidal shocking. Joint efforts from NYU\, Yale and Columbia are underwa

DESCRIPTION:Title:  On the Origins of Globular Clusters:  Using Stellar Dyn
 amics to Constrain Star Formation in the Proto-Milky Way\n\nAbstract:\nGlob
 ular Clusters are the oldest and most massive star clusters in the Milky Wa
 y\, with masses of up to over a million solar masses and ages that approach
  a Hubble time.  Given their long survival times\, these ancient relics rep
 resent the only remaining windows into star formation in the early local Un
 iverse.  However\, they have changed significantly over their lifetimes due
  to dynamics\, stellar and binary evolution. In this talk\, I will present 
 an on-going theoretical modeling campaign to rewind the dynamical clocks of
  globular clusters\, and constrain their properties as they emerged from th
 e gas-embedded phase.  The main limitation of this project is the extensive
  parameter space of plausible initial conditions that needs to be explored\
 , and the associated computational expense.  I will discuss several modelin
 g techniques that can be used to help overcome this considerable challenge.
   In particular\, I will explain how to extrapolate from only a handful of 
 models to predict the present-day properties of the entire Milky Way globul
 ar cluster population for every set of initial conditions.  By comparing th
 e results of a series of Monte Carlo and N-body simulations for cluster evo
 lution to the present-day observed cluster properties\, I will constrain th
 e initial distributions of total cluster masses\, stellar mass functions\, 
 concentrations and binary properties for the bulk of the Milky Way globular
  cluster population.  With these constraints in hand\, I will comment on wh
 at these results can tell us about the gas-embedded phase of cluster evolut
 ion\, and star formation in the early local Universe.

 ry companions \n(BH-LMXBs). The 1975 X-ray and optical outburst of A0620-00
 \, later recognized \nas the prototype BH-LMXB\, was found by visual inspec
 tion of the Harvard plates to \nhave had a similar event in 1917. With now 
 >20 dynamically confirmed BH-LMXBs\, \nand our âproduction scanningâ of the
  Harvard plates and pipeline processing for a \ncomplete astrometric and ph
 otometric solution for each resolved object\, DASCH can \nderive outburst d
 uty cycles and thus new constraints on source populations. I will \ndescrib

 \nwill enable the full-sky database (~ 1Pb) to be on line by 2017. DASCH re
 sults for \nthe first 4 BH-LMXBxs are now covered by data releases DR1 and 
 DR2. Comparison \nwith X-ray outburst rates for NS-LMXBs indicates BH-LMXBs
  are significantly over-\nproduced by a new formation mechanism. Likewise\,
  for bright AGN (e.g. 3C273 and \nthe PG sample of QSOs)\, century-long lig
 htcurves and power spectra allow new \nmeasures of QSO variability and cons
 traints on SMBH mass. I will show a few other \nearly results to illustrate
  the potential of days-to-century Time Domain Astronomy \nfor a range of ob

 egration with other geophysical datasets. Large datasets require a means by
  which to quickly and efficiently use imagery to calculate emission rates. 
 We present a suite of programs designed to semi-automatically determine emi
 ssion rates of SO2 from series of UV images. Extraction of high temporal re
 solution SO2 emission rates via this software facilitates comparison of gas
  data to geophysical data for the purposes of evaluating models of volcanic
  activity and has already proven useful at several volcanoes.\n \nIntegrate
 d UV camera and seismic measurements recorded in January 2009 at Fuego volc
 ano\, Guatemala\, provide new insight into the systemâs shallow conduit pro
 cesses. High temporal resolution SO2 data reveal patterns of SO2 emission r
 ate relative to explosions and seismic tremor that indicate tremor and dega
 ssing share a common source process. Progressive decreases in emission rate
  appear to represent inhibition of gas loss from magma as a result of rheol
 ogical stiffening in the upper conduit. Measurements of emission rate from 
 two closely-spaced vents\, made possible by the high spatial resolution of 
 the camera\, help constrain this model.\n \nUV camera measurements at Kilau
 ea volcano\, Hawaii\, in May of 2010 captured two occurrences of lava filli
 ng and draining within the summit vent. Accompanying high lava stands were 
 diminished SO2 emission rates\, decreased seismic and infrasonic tremor\, m
 inor deflation\, and slowed lava lake surface velocity. Incorporation of UV
  camera data into the multi-parameter dataset gives credence to the likelih
 ood of shallow gas accumulation as the cause of such events.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Exposing the Long Lives of Circumplanetary Disks\nAbstra
 ct:\nDuring the formation of gas giant planets\, gaseous disks form around 
 them. These disks are called circumplanetary disks\, and are believed to be
  the formation sites of satellites. Although an understanding of disk evolu
 tion is required for developing theories of satellite formation\, gas accre
 tion rates of\ncircumplanetary disks are very uncertain. The most promising
  mechanism of gas\naccretion is thought to be magnetic turbulence which is 
 driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI). For the disks to be MRI-acti
 ve\, gas in the disks must be sufficiently ionized. We built disk models fo
 r circumplanetary disks considering gas infall from protoplanetary disks ba
 sed on a 3D simulation and calculated the ionization degree to investigate 
 the MRI activeity. If there are no dust grains\, thin active layers may app
 ear at upper surface\; however\, we find that there are almost no active la
 yers in regions of satellite formation with sufficient small grains. Our re
 sults suggest that the lifetime of circumplanetary disks may be longer than
  previously thought\, perhaps longer than the parental protoplanetary disks
  if MRI is the only mechanism for gas accretion. In order to find out if th
 is is the case or not\, we need to investigate other mechanisms.

 ct: Although the identification of the progenitors of type Ia Supernovae (S
 NeIa) remains controversial\, it is generally accepted that they originate 
 from binary star systems in which at least one component is a carbon-oxygen
  white dwarf (WD)\; those systems are grouped under the wide umbrella of ca
 taclysmic variables (CVs). Current theories for SNeIa progenitors hold that
 \, either via Roche lobe overflow of the companion or via a wind\, the WD a
 ccumulates Hydrogen or Helium rich material which is then burned to C and O
  onto the WDâs surface. However\, the specifics of this scenario are far fr
 om being understood or defined\, allowing for a wealth of theories fighting
  for attention and a dearth of observations to support them. I discuss the 
 latest attempts to identify and study those controversial SNeIa progenitors
 . I also introduce the most promising progenitor in hand and I present obse
 rvational diagnostics that can reveal more members of the category.

DESCRIPTION:"Does Episodic Mass Loss Dominate the Evolution of Massive Star

  most massive stars such as eta Carinae is controlled by the effects of mas
 s-loss\, possibly dominated by poorly understood stellar eruptions and epis
 odic mass ejections. Copious mass loss leads to circumstellar dust formatio
 n\, obscuring the star in the optical. But as the light is absorbed and re-
 emitted by the dust\, these objects become very luminous in mid-infrared li
 ght. Understanding these stars is challenging because no true analogs of et
 a Car have been found so far in our or other galaxies. I present the result
 s of our systematic search for eta Car analogs in 7 galaxies utilizing Spit
 zer\, Herschel\, HST and other data. While strict eta Car analogs remain to
  be found\, if they exist\, we discovered an emerging class of luminous\, h
 eavily dust obscured\, evolved massive stars. I will describe the propertie
 s of these stars\, and discuss the implications of our findings for massive

DESCRIPTION:TITLE\nFrom clouds to cores to envelopes to disks: a multi-scal
 e view of magnetized star formation\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMagnetic fields are thou
 ght to play an important role in the formation of stars.  However\, that im
 portance has been called into question by previous observations showing mis
 alignment between protostellar outflows and magnetic fields (B-fields)\, as
  well as inconsistency in field morphology between 10\,000 AU and 1\,000 AU
  scales.  To investigate these inconsistencies\, we used the 1.3 millimeter
  full-Stokes polarimeter at CARMA to map dust polarization with ~2.5" resol
 ution toward 29 star-forming cores and 8 high-mass star-forming regions as 
 part of the TADPOL survey.  We find that a subset of the sources have consi
 stent B-field orientations between the large (~20") scales measured by sing
 le-dish submillimeter bolometers and the small scales measured by CARMA. Th
 ose same sources also tend to have higher fractional polarizations\, presum
 ably because the B-fields are less twisted by dynamic effects. However\, ev
 en in these sources\, which seem to have retained the memory of the global 
 B-field direction\, the fields in the cores are misaligned with the disks a
 nd outflows in the central protostars -- a key previous result of the TADPO
 L survey.  Furthermore\, the protostellar cores with lower polarization fra
 ctions tend to have B-fields that are preferentially perpendicular to outfl
 ows\, which suggests that in these sources the B-fields have lost the memor
 y of the larger-scale global field\, and have been wrapped up by core rotat
 ion. This is an important result for disk formation theory\, as it suggests
  that field misalignment may indeed be the solution to the magnetic braking
  catastrophe.  \n\nFor the TADPOL paper discussing the misalignment of outf
 lows and magnetic fields\, see: adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...768..159H

DESCRIPTION:Eta Carina's X-ray Flares\n\nEta Carinae is an extremely massiv
 e colliding-wind binary system containing a highly unstable Luminous Blue V
 ariable at its Eddington limit accompanied by a more modest O star in a hig
 hly elliptical (e = 0.9) 5.54-year orbit. The LBV component could be on the
  verge of exploding as a core-collapse supernova. I will present and discus
 s the rapid variations in X-ray brightness ("flares") seen in eta Car durin
 g the past three orbital cycles by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The obs

  is approached\, although the largest ones tend to be roughly constant in s
 trength at all phases. Plausible scenarios include: \n\n(1) the largest of 
 multi-scale stochastic wind clumps from the Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) co
 mponent entering and compressing the hard X-ray-emitting wind-wind collisio
 n (WWC) zone\, \n\n(2) large-scale corotating interacting regions in the LB
 V wind sweeping across the WWC zone\, or \n\n(3) instabilities intrinsic to

  clumps\, decreasing in number toward larger sizes\, as seen in Wolf-Rayet 
 winds. In this sense\, one of eta Carâs many mysteries has now been resolve

DESCRIPTION:The Mass-Transfer Formation of Blue Stragglers as Revealed by t
 heir White Dwarf Companions \n\nThe formation mechanism of blue straggler s
 tars\, defined to be brighter and bluer than the main sequence turnoff in a
  star cluster\, has been a question for almost six decades. The blue stragg
 ler population of the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 provides a unique op
 portunity to probe the formation histories of blue straggler stars in open 
 clusters. In comparison to the blue straggler populations in younger open c
 lusters and in globular clusters\, the cooler temperatures (6\,000 to 6\,75
 0 K) and close proximity (2.5 kpc) of the blue stragglers in NGC 188 allow 
 for in-depth high-resolution spectroscopic investigation. Long-term radial 
 velocity studies revealed that over 75% of the NGC 188 blue stragglers exis
 t in binaries with a prevalence of 1000-day periods and a statistical secon
 dary mass distribution that peaks at 0.5 Msolar. Using HST/ACS/SBC far-UV p
 hotometry I will present direct observational detections of young (<300 Myr
 )\, hot white dwarf companions in three blue straggler binaries. Given the 
 age distribution predicted in full N-body models\, which translates into a 
 white dwarf temperature distribution\, three detections is consistent with 
 the entire NGC 188 blue straggler population being formed via mass transfer
 . These detections affirm the prediction made by previous studies that the 
 blue straggler population of NGC 188 is dominated by mass transfer formatio
 n.

 pses are important sources of stellar variability\, no eclipsing or pulsati

 cloud cover -- possibly to storms comparable to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.  
 Precise\, multi-wavelength monitoring from the ground and space is beginnin

  dwarfs.   Such observations also confirm the existence of aperiodic variab

 iters around bright stars\, are key ingredients for understanding planetary
  formation and migration theories\, statistics of planetary properties and 
 planetary dynamics\, and are of the most favorable for observational study.
 \n\nI will present a novel approach to use low-cadence photometric surveys\
 , such as the promising Gaia Space mission for exoplanetary transit search.
  We find that even if transits are undetectable in the sparsely sampled dat
 a\, the "Directed Follow-Up strategy" (DFU) can be used to choose preferred
  times for follow-up observations that will maximize the chances to detect 
 transiting planets. Though low-cadence surveys are usually considered irrel
 evant for transit searches\, Gaia's yield can reach a few thousands of new 
 Hot Jupiters\, if the Directed Follow-Up strategy will be applied to schedu
 le and conduct a follow-up campaign.

DESCRIPTION:Title:\nSaturation of Stellar Winds from Young Suns\n\nAbstract
 :\nWe investigate mass losses via stellar winds from sun-like main sequence
  stars\nwith a wide range of activity levels. We perform forward-type\nmagn
 etohydrodynamical numerical experiments for Alfven wave-driven\nstellar win
 ds with a wide range of the input Poynting flux\nfrom the photosphere. Incr
 easing the magnetic field strength\nand the turbulent velocity at the stell
 ar photosphere\nfrom the current solar level\, the mass loss rate rapidly i
 ncreases\nat first owing to the suppression of the reflection of the Alfven
  waves.\nThe surface materials are lifted up by the magnetic pressure assoc
 iated\nwith the Alfven waves\, and the cool dense chromosphere is intermitt
 ently\nextended to 10 -- 20 % of the stellar radius. The dense atmospheres 
 enhance\nthe radiative losses and eventually most of the input Poynting ene
 rgy\nfrom the stellar surface escapes by the radiation. As a result\, there
 \nis no more sufficient energy remained for the kinetic energy of the wind\
 ;\nthe stellar wind saturates in very active stars\, as observed in Wood et
  al.\nThe saturation level is positively correlated with B_{r\,0}f_0\, wher
 e B_{r\,0}\nand f_0 are the magnetic field strength and the filling factor\
 nof open flux tubes at the photosphere. If B_{r\,0}f_0 is relatively\nlarge
  >~ 5 G\, the mass loss rate could be as high as 1000 times.\nIf such a str
 ong mass loss lasts for ~ 1 billion years\, the stellar mass\nitself is aff
 ected\, which could be a solution to the faint young sun paradox.\nWe deriv
 e a Reimers-type scaling relation that estimates the mass loss rate\nfrom t
 he energetics consideration of our simulations. Finally\, we derive\nthe ev
 olution of the mass loss rates\, \\dot{M} t^{-1.23}\, of our simulations\,\
 ncombining with an observed time evolution of X-ray flux from sun-like star
 s\,\nwhich is shallower than \\dot{M} t^{-2.33+/-0.55} in Wood et al.(2005)

DESCRIPTION:Galaxy assembly in simulations with realistic star formation an
 d feedback\n\nWe investigate the process of baryon assembly in galaxies\, f
 ocusing for the first time on the effects of radiation from young clusters 
 on the baryonic fraction and the star formation histories of galaxies simul
 ated in a cosmological setting to the present epoch. We incorporate a reali
 stic model of star formation and stellar feedback in galaxy formation simul
 ations based on the latest understanding from observations of star forming 
 regions. Our feedback model is based on observations of the mechanisms that
  disperse molecular clouds around star forming regions. We include radiatio
 n pressure from young star clusters\, as well as energy from supernova expl
 osions and stellar winds. We also implement a model of local star formation
  in which stars form in cold and dense gas with a small efficiency per free
 -fall time\, as observed in studies of galactic molecular clouds. We find t
 hat radiation pressure from young clusters has a strong effect on the star 
 formation process in galaxies\, especially at high redshift. In galaxies wi
 th masses ranging from dwarfs to massive spirals\, feedback efficiently sup
 presses star formation by dispersing and heating high density gas\, mostly 
 in the central regions\, with the potential to completely suppress the form
 ation of a massive bulge in a spiral galaxy. For the first time in simulati
 ons\, we observe the process of galaxy downsizing\, in which the early regu
 lation of the star formation due to radiative feedback is responsible for t
 he bulk of the stellar mass assembly occurring in the last half of cosmic h
 istory\, in contrast to the hierarchical assembly of the dark matter halo. 
 In addition\, the cold baryon fractions in simulated galaxies with radiativ
 e feedback are several times smaller than those obtained with only supernov
 a feedback. We conclude that radiation pressure is the only mechanism that 
 is able to dispense dense star forming gas to regulate the star formation r
 ate at high redshift\, as well as launch gas in galactic fountains and even
  massive outflows that reduce the cold baryon fraction within the halo of a
  dwarf galaxy to values 0.5-2%\, in very good agreement with abundance matc
 hing models.

DESCRIPTION:A modified bayesian analysis to search for young brown dwarfs\n
 \nIn this talk\, I will present the latest modifications we brought to our 
 Bayesian method in the goal of searching for young\, low-mass objects in ne
 arby\, young associations. With this new method\, we can assess membership 
 probabilities for objects with only their sky position and proper motion\, 
 as well as predicting their suspected radial velocity and distance. We have
  applied this method to the whole sky using the 2MASS and WISE surveys\, an
 d started a spectroscopic follow-up of the most promising candidates to sea
 rch for signs of youth in their optical and/or NIR spectra. We will present
  here our first results\, showing that we can get a fraction of young objec
 ts as high as 75% if we carefully choose which candidates to follow. We als
 o find that this specific method has the potential to unveil objects whose 
 masses span the whole range from low-mass stars to planetary-mass objects. 
 I will also briefly talk about a Montecarlo simulation that sheds light on 
 the expected recovery rate and contamination fraction of our method.

DESCRIPTION:A Tale of Two Debris Disks: Dynamical chaos around Uranus & Is 
 Fomalhaut b a planet?\n\nThe irregular satellites of each of the giant plan
 ets have generated vast quantities of dust that subsequently rained down on
  the respective inner moons due to Poynting-Robertson drag.  Uranus is uniq
 ue in that it has an extreme axial tilt of 98Â°.  This renders a range of ci
 rcumplanetary orbits around the planet unstable\, and debris that enters th
 is region will undergo chaotic\, large-amplitude oscillations in orbital ec
 centricity and inclination.  I will argue that this could explain the hemis
 pherical color asymmetries observed on the Uranian inner moons.\n\nFomalhau
 t b is a controversial candidate among the few directly-imaged exoplanets. 
  Recently\, Kalas et al. announced the results of two additional epochs of 
 observation that show this object to be on an extremely eccentric orbit.  I
  will argue that this sets stringent limits on the possible mass of Fomalha

 ent constraints on parameters from the observations at 148 and 217 GHz resp
 ectively by ACT from three years of observations. Efficient map-making and

 to the damping tail\, and allow for confirmation of the concordance model\,

 taset\, including contributions from both the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Z
 el'dovich effect\, Poisson distributed and correlated infrared sources\, ra
 dio sources and a term modeling the correlation between the thermal SZ effe
 ct and the Cosmic Infrared Background. We will describe the multi-frequency
  likelihood for the ACT data\, and present constraints on a variety of cosm
 ological parameters using this complete dataset\, and put these results in 
 context with the recent results from the Planck satellite.

 a natural outcome of orbital migration for two giant planets in a protoplan

DESCRIPTION:On the Formation and Evolution of Massive Galaxies\n\nLooking b
 ackwards we have been able to reconstruct from the detailed structure of ou
 r own Galaxy and from the fossil evidence derived from the study of nearby 
 galaxies a plausible history of how galaxies formed over the last several b
 illion years. In addition\, now that we have a quite definite cosmological 
 model\, providing us with a quantitative picture of how perturbations grew 
 from very low amplitude Gaussian fluctuations\, we can perform the forward 
 modeling of representative pieces of the universe using standard physical p
 rocesses to see how well we match our local knowledge and the time-reversed
  modeling based on the fossil evidence. Finally\, we can employ large groun
 d and space based telescopes to use the universe as a time-machine â direct
 ly observing the past history of our light-cone.  While none of these appro
 aches can give us at the present time results accurate to more than roughly
  the 5% -> 10% level\, a coherent and plausible picture is emerging.  Massi
 ve galaxies form in two phases. In the first phase\, which peaks at redshif
 t z = 6 and ends by redshift z = 2\, cold gas streams in\, making stars in 
 a small (<1kpc) region\, but as the stellar mass approaches 1011 Msolar\, a
  hot bubble forms which suppresses further inflow of cold gas. But from red
 shift z = 3 to the present time\, small stellar satellite systems are accre
 ted at typically 10kpc from the center and the size of the total system gro
 ws by about a factor of three as the mass doubles. This added\, accreted co
 mponent is mainly comprised of old and low metallicity stars. Energy releas
 e from gravitational infall in various forms will terminate star-formation 
 even in the absence of feedback from SN or MBHs. This physical picture seem
 s naturally to lead to the mass\, size\, scale and epoch of galaxy formatio
 n and\, increasingly\, to a first understanding of the detailed internal st
 ructure of these systems.

DESCRIPTION:Simulating & Analyzing the First Stars in the Universe\n\nDid t
 he first stars in the Universe form as lone giants\, ending their lives by 
 enriching their environments through disruptive supernovae? Or did they for
 m in low-mass multiples\, and should we be searching for them in our galaxy
  today?  In this talk\, I will describe efforts to develop complex\, multi-
 physics and multi-scale computer simulations that can follow the formation 
 and growth of these first stars. Conducting and processing the results of s
 uch simulations is often associated with a great degree of âtechnical frict
 ionâ: the buildup of small obstacles that\, acting in concert\, amplify the
  difficulty of deep\, intuitive understanding.  Motivated by reducing this 
 technical friction\, I will present the analysis framework yt (http://yt-pr
 oject.org/)\, designed to address the challenges of next-generation simulat
 ions in computational astrophysics.  In this talk I will present on its des
 ign and capabilities\, its community-oriented open source development\, and
  briefly describe future plans.

DESCRIPTION:Dust Reddened Quasars:  A Transitional Phase in Quasar/Galaxy C
 o-Evolution\n\nQuasars are extremely luminous sources\, powered by accretio
 n of gas onto a supermassive black hole in the nucleus of some galaxies. Mo
 st of the >100\,000 quasars identified in the literature have been selected
  using optical surveys through the "ultraviolet excess" (UVX) method.  Howe
 ver\, these samples are known to be incomplete and biased because of obscur
 ation and anisotropic radiation.  Furthermore\, a population of dust-obscur
 ed\, red quasars is predicted by merger-driven models of quasar/galaxy co-e
 volution. To test these models\, I have conducted a survey for a large popu
 lation of dust-reddened quasars identified by matching radio sources from t
 he FIRST 1.4 GHz survey with the 2MASS near-infrared survey and selecting o
 bjects with red optical-to-near-infrared colors.  Follow up spectroscopy of
  these candidates in the optical and/or near-infrared has identified 120 re
 d quasars\, defined as having at least one broad emission line and a redden
 ing of E(B-V)>0.1. The sample spans a wide redshift range\, 0.1 < z < 3 and
  reaches a reddening of E(B-V)<1.5. When corrected for extinction\, red qua
 sars are the most luminous objects at every redshift and the fraction of re
 d quasars increases with luminosity. The properties of red quasars suggest 
 that they are revealing a transitional phase where the heavily obscured qua
 sar is emerging from its dusty environment prior to becoming a "normal" blu
 e quasar.  Based on the fraction of quasars that are in this red phase\, I 
 determine that its duration is 20% as long as the unobscured quasarâs phase
 : a few million years.\n\nI will also present future and ongoing work to ex
 pand this sample to fainter flux limits and longer wavelengths.  And I will
  describe additional observations focused on subsamples of these red quasar
 s to better understand their role in the co-evolution of supermassive black
  holes and their host galaxies.

DESCRIPTION:The Astrophysics of Planet Formation\n\nOver the past twenty-on
 e years\, we have discovered nearly a thousand\nexoplanets\, planets that o
 rbit stars other than the Sun. These planets\nshow a remarkable diversity\,
  from Jupiter-mass planets orbiting with\nperiods of days to "super Earths"
  with bulk densities suggestive of\nmassive water oceans. Our census of pla
 netary possibilities is nowhere\nnear complete: each new planet-finding mis
 sion yields new classes of\nexoplanets. In order to understand this diversi
 ty\, we must start at\nthe beginning: how do planets form? How does micron-
 sized interstellar\nsilicate dust coalesce into planets with radii ranging 
 from thousands\nto more than seventy thousand km? In this talk\, I will out
 line the\nresults of a number of complimentary\, interlocking studies\, all
  with\nthe goal of creating a detailed\, predictive theory for planet\nform
 ation. My focus is on the earliest stages of planet formation\nwhere dust m
 ust begin its growth in thin\, gas-rich protoplanetary\ndisks. I will discu
 ss computer simulations and theoretical\ncalculations of the rich dynamical
  interactions between dust and\npartially ionized plasma turbulence believe
 d to be found in\nprotoplanetary disks. Our results suggest that protoplane
 tary disk\nturbulence is generated and maintained by large-scale magnetic f
 ields.\n I will talk about ongoing studies of magnetic reconnection\, a key
 \ningredient in the development of those fields. Finally\, I will\nconclude
  by discussing a new\, international collaboration I am leading\nto develop
  a set of research-grade yet pedagogically useful\ncomputational tools for 
 future exoplanetary fluid dynamics research.\nThese tools are the result of
  a collaboration between astrophysicists\,\ngeophysicists\, and applied mat
 hematicians\, with the goal of allowing a\ndiverse group of users\, from un
 dergraduates to researchers\, to study a\nmultitude of problems in protopla
 netary disks\, exoplanetary\natmospheres\, and deep stellar interiors.

DESCRIPTION:"Next Generation Tests of Substellar Evolution"\n\nA broad-brus
 h view of the evolution of photometric and spectroscopic\nproperties of bro
 wn dwarfs has been in place for nearly a decade\,\nlargely thanks to modest
  initial samples of parallaxes and a few\ndynamical masses barely breaching
  the hydrogen-fusion boundary.  I\nwill present results from our high-preci
 sion infrared astrometry\nprograms at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (C
 FHT) and Spitzer and\nlaser guide star adaptive optics orbit monitoring at 
 Keck that greatly\nexpand such tests of substellar models.  With data from 
 Keck we have\nmore than tripled the numbered of dynamical masses for ultrac
 ool\ndwarfs\, pushing to much lower temperatures than before.  This has\nre
 vealed significant discrepancies between substellar models and\nobserved co
 lors\, temperatures\, and even cooling rates\, which has\nimplications for 
 cluster IMF determinations and the inferred masses\nfor directly imaged pla
 nets.  Our large sample of parallaxes from CFHT\nprovides new perspectives 
 on the cooling of brown dwarfs: we discover\na phase of rapid cloud clearin
 g (the "L/T gap") and quantify the\nseemingly paradoxical brightening in J-
 band as objects cool from L to\nT dwarfs.  Finally\, new Spitzer parallaxes
  for Y dwarfs reveal that\nthese coldest free-floating objects may not be a
 s cold as initially\nthought from comparison of their spectra to model atmo
 spheres.

DESCRIPTION:Mid-Infrared and Millimeter Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Local 
 Luminous Infrared Galaxies\n\nI will present an analysis of of 248 luminous
  infrared galaxies (LIRGs) nuclei which comprise the Great Observatories Al
 l-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitze
 r in the rest-frame wavelength range between 5 and 38 microns. I will prese
 nt and compare several diagnostics effective at isolating the Active Galact
 ic Nuclei (AGN) contribution to the Mid-infrared (MIR) (fAGN) emission usin
 g [Ne V]\, [OI V]\, [Ne II]\, the 6.2 micron PAH EQW and the shape of the M
 IR continuum. These diagnostics suggest that between 10% and 13% of local L
 IRGs are AGN dominated in the MIR and that AGNs contribute 12% of the total
  bolometric luminosity of the entire sample. Warm H2 is detected in at leas
 t one transition in 40% of sources. I find that the H2 scales with aromatic
  band emission and [Si II]. The range of total H2 to IR ratios in LIRGs is 
 wider than in ULIRGs but similar to normal galaxies. We detect H2 resolved 
 emission and compare it with similar findings in radio galaxies and nearby 
 mergers.\n\nI will also present 16 CO (1-0) high resolution maps taken with
  the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy of 16 LIRGs. 
 We find a median mass of H2 of 2 x 1e10 Solar Masses\, with median molecula
 r gas surface densities of about 200 Solar Masses/pc2 as well as correlatio
 ns between the interaction stage and the average gas surface density and co
 ld gas depletion times. I will compare their morphologies to those of norma
 l galaxies and ULIRGs.

DESCRIPTION:Replay: Echoes of Light from Eta Carinae\n\nEta Carine  is one 
 of the most massive star systems in the Milky Way. Visible in the southern 
 hemisphere\, and known for its fitful variability\, Eta Carinae underwent a
  tremendous eruptive event in the mid-nineteenth-century -the âGreat Erupti
 onâ- which brightened Eta-Carine it to became the second-brightest star in 
 the sky. This event is generally though of as the prototype supernova impos
 tor. The Great Eruption remains however unique\, lasting over ten years\, a
 nd ejecting more than ten solar masses of material in an event that release
 d ten per cent of the energy of a typical core-collapse supernova\, without
  destroying the star. \n\nWhile it is true that "You never get a second cha
 nce to make a first impression"\, once in a while  cosmic events get a seco
 nd chance at being observed\, when light from a brightening events reflects
  off sheets of cosmic dust\, and is redirected toward earth\, allowing us t
 o re-see the eruption decades\, sometimes centuries later:  a 'light echo".
  In 2011 we discovered light echoes from EtaâCarinae's Great Eruption\, whi
 ch we can now re-observe and study with modern instrumentation.  I will sho
 w you how these light echoes force us to review our first impression of thi
 s dramatic stellar eruption.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  Variations in the Chemical Evolution of Dwarf Galaxies\
 n\nSpectroscopy of stars in nearby galaxies has become routine in the past 
 decade with the 8-10 meter class telescopes and high efficiency spectrograp
 hs. Large datasets of medium resolution spectroscopy have provided the firs
 t detailed studies of the metallicity and dynamical distributions of the st
 ars in dwarf galaxies\, and the determination of the ages for those stars h
 ave also produced the first observational constraints for the chemodynamica
 l evolution of these systems. High resolution spectroscopy has been used to
  test these models\, which implicitly make predictions on the origins\, evo
 lution\, and distribution of individual chemical elements. In this talk\, I
  would like to discuss the recent observational results for Local Group dwa
 rf galaxies\, focusing on both the classical low mass dwarf spheroidals\, i
 solated gas-rich dwarf irregulars\, and the earliest stages in the chemical
  evolution of these systems which should be related to the initial conditio
 ns of proto-galactic\nsystems in the early Universe.

DESCRIPTION:Line-of-Sight Effects in Strong Lensing\n\nGravitational lensin
 g has been instrumental in probing the mysterious dark matter that dominate
 s the matter content of our universe. While rare\, close alignment between 
 foreground galaxies and background sources can yield multiple images of the
  background source. These strong gravitational lens systems have been used 
 to map galaxy mass distributions and constrain the Hubble Constant. As data
  and models improve\, people look to achieve percent-level precision with s
 trong lensing. To reach that goal\, we need to understand and control syste
 matic uncertainties in lens models. One key systematic arises because lens 
 models often assume the light bending is confined to a single lens plane\, 
 neglecting the perturbing effects of other galaxies along the line of sight
 . Our team has used pencil-beam redshift surveys to characterize the lines 
 of sight to strong lenses. I will introduce a new analytic framework that l
 ets us include LOS galaxies in lens models in a computationally efficient w
 ay. I will present numerical simulations to quantify LOS effects and demons
 trate that our framework handles them well. Using our framework for multi-p
 lane lensing will control an important systematic as we enter the era of pr
 ecision gravitational lensing.

DESCRIPTION:The first stellar mass black holes have probably been formed in
  powerful gamma ray bursts in the early Universe. Stellar remnants of the f
 irst generation of stars have been the seeds of supermassive black holes\, 
 which we find dormant in the centers of most nearby galaxies â including ou
 r own Milky Way. Different feeding modes have been identified for growing b
 lack holes: small flares occurring almost daily in our Galactic Center blac
 k hole\; major flares\, in which an otherwise dormant black hole tidally di
 srupts and swallows a normal star. Major mergers between two galaxies seem 
 to play an important role in the feeding of black holes. In the nearby merg
 er NGC 6240 we could identify a double supermassive black hole in a single 
 galaxy\, which will merge in the future. A tight correlation between black 
 hole mass and the global properties of their host galaxies indicates a co-f
 ormation and evolution of black holes and galaxies. The X-ray sky is domina
 ted by a diffuse extragalactic background radiation\, which can almost comp
 letely be resolved into discrete sources using X-ray satellites - we observ
 e the growth phase of the population of supermassive black holes throughout
  the history of the Universe. The black holes must therefore have been form
 ed together or even before the bulk of the stars in galaxies - they are pos
 sibly the seeds of galaxy formation. What will be the fate of the black hol
 es? They can live much longer than other forms of matter and structures in 
 the Universe\, but nevertheless must evaporate after a finite time. If Dark
  Energy indeed accelerates the expansion of the Universe forever\, the most
  massive black holes can grow to hundreds of billions of solar masses\, whi
 ch can live as long as  10100 years - a truly unimaginable time span. The f
 irst compact objects\, which entered the stage of the Universe\, will then 
 also be the last ones to leave it.

  Open Clusters: An all-sky membership census \nin 8-D\nAbstract: Classical 
 Cepheids in Galactic open clusters (cluster \nCepheids: CCs) have been stud
 ied extensively for multiple decades\, \nthanks to their importance as cali
 brators of the Galactic Cepheid \nperiod-luminosity relation (PLR). We here
  revisit the calibration of the \nGalactic PLR using a new sample of CCs\, 
 since even recent calibrations \nshow significant discrepancies. The CC sam
 ple employed for the \ncalibration is based on the preliminary results of a
  self-consistent \n8-dimensional all-sky census. This census is based mostl
 y on literature \ndata\, supplemented with high-precision radial velocity o
 bservations from \nboth hemispheres. New CCs are identified from our census
  and the degree \nof confidence in membership is quantified for known candi
 dates. Using \nonly bona-fide CCs\, we obtain MV = (â3.08 Â± 0.50) log P + (
 â0.94 Â± 0.42) \n[mag]\, which is in perfect agreement with the results by S
 andage\, \nTammann & Reindl (2004)\, albeit with larger error bars and an R
 MS of \n0.21mag. The key to obtaining a meaningful calibration is to employ
  \naccurate cluster distance moduli and space reddenings. A homogeneous \ns
 tudy of all bona-fide host clusters would be desirable to increase \nprecis
 ion and confidence in the calibration.

DESCRIPTION:Herschel Reveals the Cool Universe\n\nHerschel is a cornerstone
  mission of the European Space Agency (ESA)\, with major involvement from N
 ASA.  The PACS and SPIRE instruments are moderate resolution imaging spectr
 ometers and photometers that together cover the decade in wavelength from 6
 00 to 60 microns\, with spectral resolution as high as 2000.  HIFI is a sin
 gle pixel dual-polarization heterodyne spectrometer that covers frequencies
  between 470 GHz and 1950 GHz (600 microns to 150 microns wavelength) with 
 a maximum spectral resolution in excess of 1 million.  Following launch (to
 gether with the Planck cosmology mission) on May 16\, 2009\, Herschel enter
 ed its L2 halo orbit\, and once the telescope had cooled down\, commissioni
 ng observations began.  These tests were followed by a performance verifica
 tion phase\, and finally by the start of normal science observations in Fal
 l 2009.  The PACS and SPIRE instruments were brought into routine operation
  relatively smoothly\, but HIFI suffered problems with a power supply\, whi
 ch delayed the start of science observations until February 2010.  At the p
 resent time\, instrumental performance is close to or better than that expe
 cted before launch.  Science observations are expected to extend until Marc
 h 2013\, limited by the liquid helium supply. In this talk I review the cha
 racteristics of the Herschel Space Observatory and the capabilities of its 
 three science instruments.  I will also give some highlights of the very va
 ried results from Herschel.  The access with a suite of high sensitivity im
 aging and spectroscopy systems to a largely unexplored portion of the elect
 romagnetic spectrum has resulted in an exceptionally wide range of astronom
 ical discoveries\, ranging from studies of distant galaxies\, to high-resol
 ution spectroscopy of molecular clouds and star formation in the Milky Way\
 , to observations of objects within our solar system\, with surprising resu
 lts about the origin of the Earthâs water.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Ultraviolet Properties of Type Ia Supernovae\nAbstra
 ct: Studies of the ultraviolet (UV) spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) 
 give us information about the objects themselves but are also motivated by 
 a need to understand and improve the methods used for cosmology standardisa
 tion.  Large supernova surveys have shown that supernova properties correla
 te with those of their hosts and it has been suggested that this is due to 
 different progenitor metallicities as the more massive galaxies/low star-fo
 rmation galaxies tend to be more metal-rich.  The UV region of the spectra 
 of SNe Ia is dominated by metal lines and so it is thought that any metalli
 city-driven effects would be strongest here.  I will discuss recent new obs
 ervational studies of SNe Ia and also how series of model spectra can help 
 to interpret the results.

DESCRIPTION:Title: LyÎ± Absorbers in Different Environments: Filamentary Fee
 ding and Changes in the Circumgalactic Medium.\n\nAbstract: I present the f
 irst systematic survey of multiple background QSOs behind a galaxy cluster 
 with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard HST to examine LyÎ± absorbing c
 louds in an active environment. In total\, 43 LyÎ± absorbers are found in an
 d around the Virgo Cluster with N_HI > 10^13 cm^-2 toward 23 QSO sightlines
 . We find LyÎ± absorbers are dominant in the outskirts and mostly coincide w
 ith the infalling substructures of the Virgo Cluster. This indicates a conn
 ection between the large-scale flow of gas around the cluster and gas in in
 dividual galaxies. The covering fraction of LyÎ± absorbing clouds is unity f
 or N_HI > 10^13 cm^-2 surrounding the cluster. These results are consistent
  with cosmological simulations. We also probe the known properties of the L
 yÎ± absorption lines and their relationship to individual galaxies. We find 
 that environment influences not only galaxies\, but also the circumgalactic
  medium significantly. These results provide important clues to how gas flo
 ws in different environments.

DESCRIPTION:Formation and evolution of our Moon: from the Giant Impact to t
 he Lunar Magma Ocean and what we really know\n\nThe composition of the luna
 r crust provides clues about the processes that formed it and hence contain
 s information on the origin and evolution of the Moon. Current understandin
 g of lunar evolution is built on the Lunar Magma Ocean hypothesis.  This hy
 pothesis is based on analyses of Apollo samples of ferroan anorthosites (>9
 0% plagioclase) and the assumption that early in its history\, the Moon was
  wholly or mostly molten due to the giant impact theory. Simulations of thi
 s theory have shown that a collision between the proto-Earth and a Mars-siz
 ed planet (Theia) can produce the Earth-Moon system with the correct masses
 \, orbits\, and angular momentum. 70-80% of the mass of the Moon originates
  from Theia\, not from Earth. However\, new results from lunar meteorites a
 nd data from new missions are currently revolutionizing our knowledge of th
 e Moon. These studies show a very high degree of similarity between the lig
 ht and heavy elemental composition (and their isotopes) of Earthâs mantle a
 nd the Moon. In light of these new data many of the âclassicâ views of the 
 surface\, interior\, and atmosphere of the Moon\, and their evolution throu
 gh time have changed\, however\, hypothesis such as the Lunar Magma Ocean a
 nd the Giant Impact Theory are still under debate. The compositions of anor
 thositic rock fragments in lunar meteorites are inconsistent with a global 
 Lunar Magma Ocean\, and more consistent with crustal anorthosites forming f
 rom serial emplacement of terrestrial like massifs. Moon formation models h
 ave to be consistent with the lunar chemistry but current versions of the g
 iant impact model are not. Debated alternative hypotheses\, that account fo
 r similarities between the Moon and the bulk silicate Earth\, include 1) fo
 rmation of the Moon from a hot\, fast-spinning Earth (fission model)\; 2) f
 ormation of the Moon from the ejection of terrestrial mantle material in a 
 heat-propelled jet\, triggered by a run-away natural geo-reactor at the Ear
 thâs core-mantle boundary. These alternative hypotheses are consistent with
  the identical isotopic composition of bulk silicate Earth and Moon for man
 y elements without relying on full post-collisional equilibration.

DESCRIPTION:How to Find the Rare Sources All New Surveys Promise: Machine-l
 earning Enabled Classification and Discovery\n\nThe falling costs of comput
 ing and CCD detectors has led to a great boom in wide-field time-domain opt
 ical surveys during the past ~decade\, with several new surveys expected pr
 ior to the arrival of LSST. This observational boon\, however\, comes with 
 a catch: the data rates from these surveys are so large that discovery tech
 niques heavily dependent on human intervention are becoming unviable. Ident
 ifying the extraordinary within large data sets requires an understanding a
 nd model of the more common sources. In this talk I will detail new methods
 \, which utilize semi-supervised machine-learning algorithms\, to automatic
 ally classify the light curves of time-variable sources. Using these method
 s\, we have produced a data-driven probabilistic catalog of variables found
  in the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS). We identify true outliers within t
 he data via the clustering of sources which are not classified with high si
 gnificance. This has led to the discovery of several rare systems: includin
 g four new members of the R Coronae Borealis class\, which are thought to b
 e the product of low mass white dwarf mergers\, but are underrepresented in
  the Milky Way relative to the LMC.

 solved problem. The effects of mass\, metallicity\, binarity and rotation o
 n the evolution and subsequent explosions of massive stars are not well und

DESCRIPTION:Jarita Holbrook / UCLA\, Women's Studies\n\nSince 2009 I have b
 een part of a social science study of astronomers and astronomy culture in 
 terms of professional networks\, career pathways\, and the use of databases
 . Of particular interest has been the position of underrepresented groups a
 nd women. This presentation will summarize our project findings and facilit
 ate discussion about the lack of diversity within astronomy and astrophysic
 s. The NSF abstract for the project can be found at: http://www.nsf.gov/awa
 rdsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0956589. A paper of relevance is DiTomaso
  2007 âEffects of structural position on allocation and evaluation decision
 s for scientists and engineers in industrial R&D: http://asq.sagepub.com/co
 ntent/52/2/175.short.\n\n\n(Editor: I've added the NSF abstract below)\n\nW
 omen and Minority Astronomers Strategic Engagement with Distributed\, Multi
 -Disciplinary Collaborations and Large Scale Databases\n\nIncreasingly\, re
 search in science and engineering is conducted in multidisciplinary distrib
 uted teams enabling greater access to a variety of resources. As cyberinfra
 structure becomes integrated into research\, there are accompanying changes
  in work practices\, requisite skill sets\, organizing structures and caree
 r trajectories. Research on these concomitant changes is in its earliest st
 ages so it has focused predominantly on commonalities among the majority of
  scientists. However\, previous literature has determined that there is oft
 en considerable variation in the ways that majority and minority groups wit
 hin a field experience scientific work. Very little is know about the diffe
 rent experiences of minority group members working in multi-disciplinary\, 
 distributed collaborative research teams or about their distinctive work pr
 actices within those collaborative projects. As scientific and engineering 
 research moves toward this new cyber-enabled collaborative model\, understa
 nding both majority and minority member experiences will be crucial to the 
 design\, development and deployment of appropriate cyberinfrastructure supp
 ort tools and will have important implications for increasing participation
  among members of underrepresented groups. This research is a first step in
  identifying best practices in use so that all groups can be fully supporte
 d in scientific and engineering research collaborations.\n\nThis project in
 vestigates how women scientists engaged in collaborative\, multidisciplinar
 y research build and use interpersonal relationships and the effects of the
 se relationships on their careers. Using ethnographic methods and narrative
  analysis\, the research team will conduct a pilot study of researchers usi
 ng large-scale databases in astronomy to identify everyday research practic
 es\, the organization of work\, planning\, career trajectories\, and the tr
 ansmission of knowledge to the next generation of scholars. They will focus
  on collaborative work practices\, the design\, maintenance\, revision and 
 interpretation of large-scale databases\, their career strategies\, and on 
 mentoring activities. Further\, it will shed light on whether underrepresen
 ted groups are more likely to succeed in new fields or using new methods an
 d are more likely to engage in interdisciplinary research. If so\, they may
  be a crucial asset in innovation and transformative science.\n\nThis resea
 rch has important implications for both theory and practice. It investigate
 s an area related to cyberinfrastructure use and team science and engineeri
 ng that is currently understudied: How do minority group members use cyberi
 nfrastructure and the emergent team science structure to achieve success? H
 ow can this information inform the development and refinement of the next g
 eneration of cyberinfrastructure? What steps can be taken to improve partic
 ipation by members of underrepresented groups? New cyberinfrastructure tool
 s have enabled transformative changes for some areas of science and enginee
 ring\, but little is known about which of these changes differ for various 
 groups and how each achieves success. Results of this project could enable 
 us to design collaborative science and engineering projects that increase t
 he participation of underrepresented groups and provide valuable informatio
 n for the development of appropriate cyberinfrastructure to support a varie
 ty of work practices. Identifying the experiences of minority group members
  will enable funding agencies to better understand how to support and nurtu
 re the work required to meet future scientific and engineering challenges a
 nd improve national competitiveness. \n

DESCRIPTION:Novae as Super-Eddington Steady States\n\nNir J. Shaviv\nRacah 
 Institute of Physics\, Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n\nThe high luminosit
 ies and long decays of classical novae imply that they should be described 
 as evolving super-Eddington steady states. We will begin by describing how 
 such states can existâthrough the rise of a "porous layer" which reduces th
 e effective opacity\, and then discuss various characteristics of these sta
 tes\, such as the presence of continuum driven winds. We then modify the st
 ellar structure equations to describe these characteristics. The result is 
 a modification of the classical core-mass/luminosity relation to include th
 e super-Eddington state. The evolution of this state through mass loss desc
 ribes classical nova light curves. \n

DESCRIPTION:The magnetic fields (or lack thereof) in massive stars with dis
 crete absorption components\n\nDiscrete Absorption Components (DACs) are ob
 served in saturated ultraviolet resonance lines of many\, and possibly all\
 , hot massive stars. This type of spectral variability is attributed to the
  presence of large-scale azimuthal structures present in their supersonic\,
  radiatively-driven winds. However\, the origin of these structures continu
 es to be hotly debated. One leading hypothesis proposes the presence of "ho
 t spots" on the surface of the star\, which enhance the local speed and den
 sity of the wind\, leading to fast wind streams which interact to form the 
 observed structures. Such surface features have been attributed to the pres
 ence of magnetic fields at the stellar surface. This investigation seeks to
  test this hypothesis by searching for evidence of weak\, large-scale magne
 tic fields in a small sample of bright\, well-studied DAC stars. High preci
 sion spectropolarimetic observations\, obtained at the CFHT and Pic du Midi
  observatories by the MiMeS collaboration\, were used to diagnose the prese
 nce (or place upper limits on the strength) of magnetic fields in the stell
 ar sample. This presentation reports the first results of this study. Furth
 ermore\, I will briefly discuss previous results on the mysterious WR binar
 y CV Ser.

DESCRIPTION:Experiments With IDENTIKIT\n\nTidal interactions twist galaxies
  into strange and beautiful forms.  Interactions and subsequent mergers bet
 ween galaxies may trigger starbursts\, fuel AGNs\, and transform disk galax
 ies into ellipticals.  IDENTIKIT was originally developed as a fast approxi
 mate scheme for modeling the tidal morphology and  kinematics of interactin

 ive modeling tool for galaxy collisions\; tests with  artificial data showe
 d that the morphology and kinematics of merging galaxies strongly constrain
  their initial conditions.  This tool is now being applied to real galaxies
 .  More recently\, IDENTIKIT has been used to develop a mapping from the pr
 esent state of a tidal encounter back to the initial conditions\; this offe
 rs a way to partly automate the search for dynamical models of galaxy encou
 nters.  Finally\, IDENTIKIT's theoretical applications include a comprehens

DESCRIPTION:Title: The debris disk - terrestrial planet connection\n\nAbstr
 act: \nThere exists strong circumstantial evidence from their eccentric orb
 its that most of the known extra-solar planetary systems are the survivors 
 of violent dynamical instabilities. Here we explore the effect of giant pla
 net instabilities on the formation and survival of terrestrial planets. We 
 numerically simulate the evolution of planetary systems around Sun-like sta
 rs that include three components: (i) an inner disk of planetesimals and pl
 anetary embryos\; (ii) three giant planets at Jupiter-Saturn distances\; an
 d (iii) an outer disk of planetesimals comparable to estimates of the primi
 tive Kuiper belt.  Our main result is a strong correlation between the evol
 ution of the inner and outer parts of planetary systems\, i.e. between the 
 presence of terrestrial planets and debris disks. Strong giant planet insta
 bilities - that produce very eccentric surviving planets - destroy all rock
 y material in the system\, including fully-formed terrestrial planets if th
 e instabilities occur late\, and also destroy the icy planetesimal populati
 on. Stable or weakly unstable systems allow terrestrial planets to accrete 
 in their inner regions and significant dust to be produced in their outer r
 egions\, detectable at mid-infrared wavelengths as debris disks. Stars olde
 r than ~100 Myr with bright cold dust emission (in particular at Î» ~ 70 Î¼m)
  signpost dynamically calm environments that were conducive to efficient te
 rrestrial accretion. Such emission is present around ~16% of billion-year o
 ld Solar-type stars.\n

 laboratories for cosmology and astrophysics. Being the\nlargest and most ma
 gnificent structures in the Universe\, clusters of\ngalaxies serve as excel
 lent tracers of the growth of cosmic\nstructures.  The current generation o
 f cluster surveys have provided\nindependent confirmation of the cosmic acc
 eleration and significantly\ntighten constraints on the nature of mysteriou
 s dark energy and dark\nmatter as well as new insights into how the most ma
 ssive galaxies and\nblack holes form and grow in the Universe. A number of 
 new surveys are\nunderway to test our understanding of the structure format
 ion and\nfundamental physics of the cosmos. In this talk\, I will review re
 cent\nadvances and future challenges at the new crossroads of cosmology and
 \nastrophysics.\n

DESCRIPTION:Project Minerva: Big Exoplanet Science from Small Telescopes\n\
 nThe Kepler mission has identified over 2300 candidate planets in the past 
 two years\, adding to the over 500 confirmed planets from radial velocity (
 RV) surveys. One of the most striking results of these surveys is that the 
 number of planets increases rapidly with decreasing size. There may in fact
  be more Earth-like planets in the Galaxy than stars. There must be terrest
 rial-sized planets around nearby stars\, though few have yet been discovere
 d. Finding these planets requires high precision RV observations and high c
 adence transit observing to densely sample the orbital phase. Project Miner
 va will surmount these obstacles with a dedicated observatory for detection
  of super-Earths and close-in Earth-like planets. Our array of four 0.7-m t
 elescopes will operate in two modes: jointly with a high precision fiber-fe
 d spectrometer capable of detecting the RV signal of an Earth orbiting a lo
 w mass star\, and independently for photometric transit detection surveys. 
 Minerva is a multi-institution collaboration among Caltech\, the University
  of Montana and Penn State University.

DESCRIPTION:Overview of the James Webb Space Telescope Observatory and its 
 Capabilities for Exoplanet Observations\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (
 JWST) is a cryogenic\, 6.5 meter diameter space telescope. JWST has a uniqu
 e architecture\, compared to previous space telescopes\, that is driven by 
 its science requirements\, a passively cooled cryogenic design\, and the ne
 ed to stow the observatory for launch. JWST's large\, segmented mirror meet
 s the requirement for high angular resolution in the infrared\, coupled wit
 h a significant increase in collecting area compared to the Spitzer and Hub
 ble Space telescopes in order to detect the first galaxies. JWST's unique f
 ive-layer sunshield allows the telescope and instrument module to passively
  cool to cryogenic temperatures. JWST will be launched on an Ariane 5\, and
  so both its telescope optics\, and the sunshield have to be stowed in orde
 r to fit the Ariane 5 fairing. Following launch the sunshield and telescope
  optics must be deployed\, and the primary mirror phased for science operat
 ions. In this presentation we will review the design of the observatory and
  highlight recent progress in the construction of the JWST observatory. In 
 particular\, we address recent progress with the telescope optics\, sunshie
 ld and spacecraft. We also review the expected scientific performance of th
 e  observatory for observations of exosolar planets by means of transit  ph
 otometry and spectroscopy\, and direct coronagraphic imaging.

DESCRIPTION: Accretion of Warm Ionized Gas in Milky Way-Sized Galaxies at L
 ow z\n\nThe Milky Way has been forming stars at a nearly constant rate of 1
 -3 Msun/yr over the past several billion years.  It would have exhausted it
 s gas reservoir in the disk on a significantly shorter timescale\, unless t
 he gas supply was replenished continuously.  The source of this fuel for st
 ar formation is unclear.  Based on high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations
  of a Milky Way-mass galaxy in a fully cosmological setting\, we argue that
  (1) the gas inflow occurs mostly along filamentary structures in the halo\
 ; and (2) the warm-hot (T = 10^5--10^6 K) and hot (T > 10^6 K) ionized gase
 s dominate the overall mass accretion in the system over a large range of d
 istances\, extending from the virial radius to the vicinity of the disk.  M
 ost of the inflowing gas (by mass) does not cool\, and the small fraction t
 hat manages to cool does so primarily close to the galaxy (R <~ 20 kpc)\, p
 erhaps comprising the neutral gas that may be detectable as\, e.g.\, high-v
 elocity clouds.  The neutral clouds are embedded within larger\, accreting 
 filamentary flows\, and represent only a small fraction of the total mass i
 nflow rate.  The inflowing gas has relatively low metallicity (Z/Z_solar < 
 0.2).  The outer layers of the filamentary inflows are heated due to compre
 ssion as they approach the disk.  In addition to the inflow\, we find high-
 velocity\, metal-enriched outflows of hot gas driven by supernova feedback.
   Our results are consistent with observations of halo gas at low z.\n\n\nB

DESCRIPTION:Electromagnetic Emission from Supermassive Black Hole Mergers\n
 \nI will review ideas that may be useful in identifying electromagnetic\n(E
 M) emission from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. In\nparticular\, 
 any detectable EM emission is likely to be time-variable\,\nwhich should ai
 d in this identification. I will discuss four\npossibilities for such varia
 ble emission: (i) a roughly periodic\nsignal due to the orbital motion prio
 r to coalescence\, (ii) a\ntransient pre-cursor caused by the gas trapped i
 nside the binary's\norbit\, and transients "after-glows" produced by (iii) 
 post-merger gas\naccretion and (iv) by merger-induced shocks in the circumb

 d\nto identify unique counterparts of gravitational wave sources expected\n
 to be detected by LISA and by Pulsar Timing Arrays.  I will also\nhighlight
  the extra science that will be enabled if an EM counterpart\nis found\, su

 in the different silicate phases of chondrules in the carbonaceous chondrit

 tween carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrites\, and to what extent it 
 may be accounted by fractionation of chondritic components by aerodynamic f
 orces. Genetic and chronological implications will be discussed.

DESCRIPTION:Two short talks:\n\nTitle: 1D microphysical cloud model for Ear
 th and Earth-like exoplanets\, water clouds in the convective troposphere\n
 A. Zsom\, L. Kaltenegger\, C. Goldblatt\n\n1D codes that are used to model 
 exoplanet atmospheres often treat clouds in an approximate way: the surface
  albedo is increased to mimic the effects of clouds (Kasting et al.\, 1993\
 , Pavlov et al.\, 2000)\, or the measured cloud properties of Earth are ado
 pted as standard (Kitzmann et al.\, 2010\, Goldblatt et al.\, 2011). The fo
 rmer method introduces errors to the modeled spectra of the exoplanet\, as 
 clouds shield the lower atmosphere and thus modify the spectral features. T
 he latter method works only for an exact Earth-analog\, but it is challengi
 ng to extend to other planets.\nTo address this issue\, we developed a micr
 ophysical cloud model\, which calculates the cloud properties self-consiste
 ntly. As a test\, the cloud model can reproduce the observed properties of 
 Earth\, such as the average albedo\, surface temperature\, and the global e
 nergy budget. In this talk\, I will describe the cloud model\, its assumpti
 ons and free parameters\, and show how the free parameters (such as cloud f
 raction\, aerosol number density\, etc.) influence the climate of Earth.\n\
 n\nTitle: A 1D cloud model for brown dwarfs\nA. Zsom\, C. Helling\n\nThe st
 ate of the art cloud models for hot-Jupiters (Helling et al. 2006) simulate
  nucleation and mixing of vapors\, as well as the condensation\, vertical s
 edimentation\, and mixing of particles\, but do not include particle coagul
 ation. Using time-scale arguments\, I show that coagulation can significant
 ly alter the particle size distribution and should not be neglected. I star
 ted develop a new Monte Carlo-based cloud model that includes all of the ab
 ove-described physical processes. During the last 15 minutes of my talk\, I
  will shortly introduce the model of Helling et al. 2006\, describe how thi
 s new cloud model will improve on it\, and show preliminary results on the 
 code development. \n

 , exploring both the dynamical effects (such as transit timing variations) 
 and the eclipse effects (such as mutual eclipses) which may be observable.

 for HEK along with the present status of the project.\n

DESCRIPTION:Vertical structure of a supernova-driven\, tubulent\, magnetise
 d ISM\n\nSupernovae drive the circulation of interstellar material both wit
 hin galaxies and into galactic haloes. I will present 3D MHD simulations of
  a modelled ISM with parameterized heating and cooling in which supernovae 
 drive turbulence and establish a vertically-stratified\, multi-phase medium
 . The resulting turbulent and thermal pressures support the disk of each co
 mponent\, producing relative scale heights in line with observations. The m
 agnetic field has relatively little impact on the scale heights of differen
 t phases of the ISM in our models. This feedback naturally allows ionizing 
 radiation from O stars in the disk to photoionize the warm ionized medium\,
  and some fraction of the ionizing photons escape from the disk into the Ga
 lactic halo. Cold and warm ($T \\lesssim 10^4$~K) gas in high velocity clou
 ds can thus be photoionized by Lyman continuum radiation emitted in the dis
 k\, consistent with observations that the H-alpha-emitting mass in the Smit
 h Cloud is comparable to the H I-emitting mass.\n

 all hang in the balance until we know if\, or how relativity theory fails.\

DESCRIPTION:Contrary to their dimness\, M-dwarf stars hold significant prom
 ise for illuminating the processes that govern the formation and evolution 
 of stars\, planets\, and the Milky Way. Calibrating the fundamental paramet
 ers of M-dwarfs\, however\, is a difficult challenge from both an observati
 onal and theoretical perspective. In particular\, the determination of thei
 r metallicities has proved to be extremely problematic. To address this pro
 blem\, we obtained K-band spectra for 133 nearby (d<33 parsecs) M-dwarfs\, 
 including 18 M-dwarfs with FGK companions\, 11 M-dwarf planet hosts\, more 
 than 2/3 of the M-dwarfs in the Northern 8pc sample\, and several M-dwarfs 
 from the LSPM catalog. From these spectra\, we measured equivalent widths o
 f the Ca and Na lines\, and a spectral index quantifying the absorption due
  to H2O opacity. We used the strength of the Na\, Ca and H2O features of 18
  M-dwarfs with reliable metallicity estimates from FGK companions to constr
 uct an empirical [Fe/H] indicator applicable for M dwarfs with near-solar m
 etallicities (-0.69<[Fe/H]<+0.31\,sigma=0.141 dex). For the first time\, we
  derive an expression for an M-dwarf's overall metallicity [M/H]\; quantita
 tive comparisons to model atmospheres\, which are benchmarked according to 
 overall metallicity\, provide a qualitative validation of our approach\, bu
 t also demonstrate an overall offset between the atomic line strengths pred
 icted by models as compared to actual observations. Our metallicity estimat
 es reproduce expected correlations between metallicity and Galactic space m
 otions and HÎ± emission line strengths\, as well as returning statistically 
 identical metallicities for M-dwarf companions within a shorted multiple sy
 stem. Finally\, we provide a list with promising M-dwarfs targets for plane
 t searches in the Solar Neighborhood based on their metallicity\, HÎ± emissi
 on\, and rotation.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: The gas between the stars in our galaxy fundamentally
  affects how our galaxy\, the Milky Way\, behaves.   It provides the materi
 al from which new stars form\, absorbs the material cast off of massive sta
 rs when they die\, and stores material for the creation of future stars.  N
 ot only does gas permeate the galaxy's disk\, where most of the galaxy's st
 ars are found\, but it also resides above the disk\, in the galaxy's halo. 
   Observations reveal that much of the gas in the halo is extremely hot (T 
 ~ a million degrees K).  Heating large quantities of gas to such high tempe
 ratures requires\nextremely large energy sources.    Thus\, the hot gas tha
 t we see now can be treated as a tracer of extremely energetic events that 
 occurred in our galaxy's past.    It is a window into the Milky Way's histo
 ry and behavior.  However\, our galaxy is capable of creating hot gas by ma
 ny means\, so astronomers must determine which types of events heated the g
 as in the halo.  The most well known explanation is that clustered supernov
 a explosions energize gas in the disk and that this gas later expands into 
 the halo.   However\, individual supernova explosions and infalling interga
 lactic gas could also be important.  In this talk\, I will discuss the obse
 rved characteristics of the hot gas in the halo and will relate these chara
 cteristics to the types of events that may have heated the gas in our galax
 y.

 nity consisting of 13 partner\ninstitutions.  The two primary instruments o
 n SALT are SALTICAM and\nthe Robbie Stobbie Spectrograph (RSS) and by far\,
  the majority of the\nearly science produced by SALT will be from these two
  instruments.\nThese instruments provide a range of observing modes\, inclu
 ding\nFabry-Perot imaging\, polarimetry\, and high speed photometry.  Due t
 o\nthe large user community\, resources available\, and unique observations
 \nmodes of SALT\, the development of reduction and analysis software is\nke
 y to maximizing the scientific return of the telescope.  We describe\nthe c
 urrent efforts at SAAO to develop PySALT\, a set of tools for the\nreductio
 ns and analysis of SALT data.  PySALT is developed in the\nPython/PyRAF env
 ironment and takes advantage of the large library of\nopen-source astronomi
 cal software.  The goals in the development of\nPySALT are: (1) Provide sci
 ence quality reductions for the major\noperational modes of SALT\, (2) Crea
 te analysis tools for the unique\nmodes of SALT\, and (3) Create a framewor
 k for the archiving and\ndistribution of SALT data. The benefits in develop
 ing PySALT are\nhighlighted through early results from high-speed photometr
 y from\nSALT.  Finally\, we discuss the planned development for PySALT alon

DESCRIPTION:Data Stream Integration for Modeling Exosystems\n\nThe pace of 
 exoplanet discovery has been steadily accelerating.  New detection methods 
 are progressively mapping out more and more of the parameter space of plane
 tary and orbital characteristics.  Early results from Kepler and plans for 
 future ground-based surveys indicate that future exoplanet databases will p
 rovide us with detailed statistics on many different planet types.  Given t
 he expectation that future databases will include many different observatio
 ns of the same targets\, it is useful to consider how these varying data st
 reams may interact.  If we assume that any data gathered about an extra-sol
 ar planetary system (exosystem) is a partial observation of a single underl
 ying system\, then all observations can be used to construct a unified exos
 ystem model.  To do so\, we must treat data streams as partial observations
  of a Markov process\, governed by the known laws of gravity and optics\, a
 nd relate them to a common parameter set.  We also need to accurately quant
 ify the error of the measurement.  I present a candidate parameter set suit
 able for multiple observing techniques used today and a method for incorpor
 ating observations into a common exosystem model.  Priors for the exosystem
  state are calculated from known exoplanet statistics\, and multiple method
 s are considered for calculating posterior parameter distributions given ne
 w observations.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: The gas between the stars in our galaxy fundamentally
  affects how our galaxy\, the Milky Way\, behaves.   It provides the materi
 al from which new stars form\, absorbs the material cast off of massive sta
 rs when they die\, and stores material for the creation of future stars.  N
 ot only does gas permeate the galaxy's disk\, where most of the galaxy's st
 ars are found\, but it also resides above the disk\, in the galaxy's halo. 
   Observations reveal that much of the gas in the halo is extremely hot (T 
 ~ a million degrees K).  Heating large quantities of gas to such high tempe
 ratures requires\nextremely large energy sources.    Thus\, the hot gas tha
 t we see now can be treated as a tracer of extremely energetic events that 
 occurred in our galaxy's past.    It is a window into the Milky Way's histo
 ry and behavior.  However\, our galaxy is capable of creating hot gas by ma
 ny means\, so astronomers must determine which types of events heated the g
 as in the halo.  The most well known explanation is that clustered supernov
 a explosions energize gas in the disk and that this gas later expands into 
 the halo.   However\, individual supernova explosions and infalling interga
 lactic gas could also be important.  In this talk\, I will discuss the obse
 rved characteristics of the hot gas in the halo and will relate these chara
 cteristics to the types of events that may have heated the gas in our galax
 y.

DESCRIPTION:Data Stream Integration for Modeling Exosystems\n\nThe pace of 
 exoplanet discovery has been steadily accelerating.  New detection methods 
 are progressively mapping out more and more of the parameter space of plane
 tary and orbital characteristics.  Early results from Kepler and plans for 
 future ground-based surveys indicate that future exoplanet databases will p
 rovide us with detailed statistics on many different planet types.  Given t
 he expectation that future databases will include many different observatio
 ns of the same targets\, it is useful to consider how these varying data st
 reams may interact.  If we assume that any data gathered about an extra-sol
 ar planetary system (exosystem) is a partial observation of a single underl
 ying system\, then all observations can be used to construct a unified exos
 ystem model.  To do so\, we must treat data streams as partial observations
  of a Markov process\, governed by the known laws of gravity and optics\, a
 nd relate them to a common parameter set.  We also need to accurately quant
 ify the error of the measurement.  I present a candidate parameter set suit
 able for multiple observing techniques used today and a method for incorpor
 ating observations into a common exosystem model.  Priors for the exosystem
  state are calculated from known exoplanet statistics\, and multiple method
 s are considered for calculating posterior parameter distributions given ne
 w observations.

DESCRIPTION:PySALT:  The SALT Science Pipeline\n\nThe Southern African Larg
 e Telescope (SALT) is a modern 10m class\ntelescope with a large user commu
 nity consisting of 13 partner\ninstitutions.  The two primary instruments o
 n SALT are SALTICAM and\nthe Robbie Stobbie Spectrograph (RSS) and by far\,
  the majority of the\nearly science produced by SALT will be from these two
  instruments.\nThese instruments provide a range of observing modes\, inclu
 ding\nFabry-Perot imaging\, polarimetry\, and high speed photometry.  Due t
 o\nthe large user community\, resources available\, and unique observations
 \nmodes of SALT\, the development of reduction and analysis software is\nke
 y to maximizing the scientific return of the telescope.  We describe\nthe c
 urrent efforts at SAAO to develop PySALT\, a set of tools for the\nreductio
 ns and analysis of SALT data.  PySALT is developed in the\nPython/PyRAF env
 ironment and takes advantage of the large library of\nopen-source astronomi
 cal software.  The goals in the development of\nPySALT are: (1) Provide sci
 ence quality reductions for the major\noperational modes of SALT\, (2) Crea
 te analysis tools for the unique\nmodes of SALT\, and (3) Create a framewor
 k for the archiving and\ndistribution of SALT data. The benefits in develop
 ing PySALT are\nhighlighted through early results from high-speed photometr
 y from\nSALT.  Finally\, we discuss the planned development for PySALT alon

DESCRIPTION:Neptune's Atmospheric Dynamics from Millimeter and Near-Infrare
 d Observations\n\nStatia Luszcz-Cook / Berkeley\n\nSolar System science has
  the unique advantage that objects are close enough to explore directly. Ho
 wever\, while recent and ongoing space programs exist for the terrestrial p
 lanets\, and for the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn\, the ice giants have be
 en visited only once\, by Voyager 2 in the 1980's. Further spacecraft explo
 ration of Uranus or Neptune is unlikely for at least two more decades. Ther
 efore\, Earth-based observational techniques are instrumental to our contin
 ued progress towards understanding the ice giant planets.\n\nI will discuss
  recent work that aims to better understand Neptune's global atmospheric dy
 namics through the analysis of state-of-the art ground-based near-infrared 
 and millimeter observations. Using OSIRIS\, the near-infrared AO-assisted f
 ield-integral spectrometer on Keck II\, we unambiguously measure spectra fo
 r individual clouds on Neptune's disk. These data\, analyzed with our radia
 tive transfer models\, enable us to assess latitudinal and vertical variati
 ons in cloud properties\, which constrain other atmospheric properties such
  as vertical wind shear\, velocity dispersion\, and meridional circulation.
  Using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA)
 \, we observe disequilibrium species in Neptune's atmosphere\, allowing us 
 to probe Neptune's global composition\, circulation\, and external environm
 ent. This research educates extrasolar planet atmospheric models\, and prov
 ides important clues for understanding the formation and evolution of our o
 wn Solar System.\n\n\nBackground material:\nhttp://www.geochemsoc.org/publi

DESCRIPTION:``Retired'' Planet Hosts: Not So Massive\, Maybe Just Portly Af
 ter Lunch\n\nJames P. Lloyd\nDepartment of Astronomy\, Cornell University\,
  Ithaca NY\n\nStudies of the planet abundance as a function of stellar mass
  have shown a strong increase in the frequency of planet occurrence around 
 stars more massive than 1.5 Msun\, and that such stars are deficit in short
  period planets.  These planet searches have relied on giant stars for a sa
 mple of high mass stars\, which are hostile to precision Doppler measuremen
 ts while on the main sequence due to rotation and activity.  However\, the 
 observationally inferred mass for exoplanet hosting giants is inconsistent 
 with the expected masses of a sample of field giants.  These stars are more
  likely to have originated from a main sequence population of late F/early 
 G dwarfs with mass 1.0-1.2 Msun\, only slightly more more massive than the 
 typical FGK dwarfs with Doppler detected planets.  The erroneous mass deter
 minations most likely arise from the extrapolation of solar-calibrated mixi
 ng length theory to the red giant branch\, and suggests that the isochrones
  need revision with a slightly larger mixing length on the red giant branch
 .  The deficit of short period planets is most likely explained by tidal ca
 pture.  The planet abundance increase requires either a high rate of false 
 positives in giant stars due to signals of stellar origin or a new mechanis
 m to migrate planets inwards during the post main sequence evolution of the
  host star.

DESCRIPTION:Planet Hunters: Searching for Exoplanets with 340\,000 Eyes \n\
 nPlanet Hunters (http://www.planethunters.org)\, part of the Zooniverse \nc
 ollection of citizen science projects\, enlists the general public to \nvis
 ually identify transits in the publicly released Kepler data via the \nWorl
 d Wide Web. The human brain is a superb pattern recognition device \nand wi
 th minimal training can often outperform the most sophisticated \nmachine l
 earning devices. The human eye is well suited to picking out \nmost transit
 s that cannot be detected in periodograms and may be missed \nby the automa
 ted search algorithms. It is unrealistic to expect a single \nindividual or
  a small group of experts to review the entire Kepler \ndata set\, but with
  over 170\,000 volunteers examining the light curves on \nthe Planet Hunter
 s interface\, we have the ability to visually inspect \nthe entire public d
 ata set for signatures of exoplanet transits. \n\nPlanet Hunters is a novel
  and complementary technique to the automated \ntransit detection algorithm
 s\, providing an independent assessment of the \ncompleteness of the Kepler
  exoplanet inventory. I will discuss the first \nresults from analyzing the
  first two quarters of Kepler observations \n(~120 days of observations) an
 d present planet candidates identified by \nPlanet Hunters comparing to the
  Kepler teamâs published lists of planet \ncandidates. In particular\, I wi
 ll focus on the abundance of large \nplanets (>  2 earth radii) on short pe
 riod (<  15 days) orbits based on \nPlanet Hunters detections. \n\n\nFor th

DESCRIPTION:Data Stream Integration for Modeling Exosystems\n\nThe pace of 
 exoplanet discovery has been steadily accelerating.  New detection methods 
 are progressively mapping out more and more of the parameter space of plane
 tary and orbital characteristics.  Early results from Kepler and plans for 
 future ground-based surveys indicate that future exoplanet databases will p
 rovide us with detailed statistics on many different planet types.  Given t
 he expectation that future databases will include many different observatio
 ns of the same targets\, it is useful to consider how these varying data st
 reams may interact.  If we assume that any data gathered about an extra-sol
 ar planetary system (exosystem) is a partial observation of a single underl
 ying system\, then all observations can be used to construct a unified exos
 ystem model.  To do so\, we must treat data streams as partial observations
  of a Markov process\, governed by the known laws of gravity and optics\, a
 nd relate them to a common parameter set.  We also need to accurately quant
 ify the error of the measurement.  I present a candidate parameter set suit
 able for multiple observing techniques used today and a method for incorpor
 ating observations into a common exosystem model.  Priors for the exosystem
  state are calculated from known exoplanet statistics\, and multiple method
 s are considered for calculating posterior parameter distributions given ne
 w observations.

DESCRIPTION:Near-Infrared Observations Toward Protostars as Proxies for Sol
 ar System Chemical Evolution\n\nComparing isotopic ratios toward young stel
 lar objects and molecular clouds to meteoritic data is a powerful tool for 
 informing our understanding of early Solar System chemistry. High-resolutio
 n near-infrared CO spectra were obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph (R = 
 95\,000) on the Very Large Telescope for several low- to intermediate- mass
  young stellar objects and foreground clouds in the local Solar neighborhoo
 d. Precise column densities and oxygen and carbon isotope ratios were deriv
 ed from the line profiles of 12C16O\, 13C16O\, 12C18O and 12C17O isotopolog
 ues. Signatures of CO self-shielding were found in the oxygen isotope ratio
 s toward several targets. The derived [12C]/[13C] ratios range from approxi
 mately 84 â 158\, values that are significantly higher than those of the am
 bient parent clouds (65 â 68). There is a general positive trend between th
 e solid [12C16O] and gas-phase [12C16O] /[13C16O]\, suggesting that partiti
 oning of the 12C16O and 13C16O isotopologues between ice and gas may partia
 lly explain the spread in [12CO]/[13CO] observed in the gas. These results 
 indicate that CO isotopologue fractionation between ice and gas may play a 
 significant role in protostellar chemistry\, and should be considered in mo
 dels including early Solar System chemistry. I will discuss these results a
 nd  my plans for new protostellar observations and theoretical models in th
 e context of the new astronomy laboratory at the North Carolina Museum of N
 atural Sciences. \n\nReview:\nhttp://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011LPI....42.1

DESCRIPTION:Identifying Planet-Forming Disks Around Young Stars\n \nTheoret
 ical simulations predict that a young planet will interact with\nthe accret
 ion disk surrounding its host star\, clearing the material\naround itself a
 nd leaving behind an observational signature in the\nform of a clearing in 
 the disk. Circumstellar disks with large\, inner\nholes have been detected 
 and are known as "transitional disks." A few\nyears ago\, Spitzer identifie
 d a new class of "pre-transitional disks"\nwhich have gaps rather than hole
 s - they have an inner disk\, a gap\, and\nan outer disk. These gapped disk
 s are currently the clearest evidence of\nthe earliest stages of disk clear
 ing by planets and serve as signposts to\nguide young planet searches in th
 e ALMA era.\n\nReview: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...700.1017K

DESCRIPTION:The Role of Dwarf Galaxy Interactions in Shaping the Magellanic
  System and Implications for Magellanic Irregulars and Dwarf Spheroidals \n
 \nAbstract: \n\nI will present a new numerical model of the evolution of th
 e Milky Way's largest satellite galaxies\, the Large and Small Magellanic C
 louds (LMC/SMC)\, in which their current internal structure and kinematics 
 and large-scale gas morphology are dictated by their mutual tidal interacti
 ons\, rather than interactions with the Milky Way. This picture is consiste
 nt with the recent HST proper motions of the LMC (Kallivayalil et al. 2006)
  - using cosmologically motivated models for the Milky Way\, these new prop
 er motions imply that the Clouds have not made multiple passages about the 
 Milky Way. \n\nIn particular\, the LMC's peculiar off-center bar and one-ar
 med spiral morphology is a natural by-product of a recent direct collision 
 with the SMC.  This scenario may shed light on the dynamical state of a cla
 ss of dwarf galaxies known as Magellanic Irregulars (de Vaucouleurs & Freem
 an 1972)\, which\, like the LMC\, are asymmetric spirals with off-center ba
 rs\, but are rarely associated with massive spirals. \n\nAs a result of its
  collision with the LMC\, the simulated SMC is left in a highly disturbed s
 tate where its older stellar population does not display a pronounced rotat
 ion curve\, as observed. The SMC may thus represent an object in transition
  from a dwarf Irregular galaxy to a dwarf Spheroidal.  This process is expe
 cted to occur ubiquitously in small groups of low mass galaxies and may rep
 resent a generic mode of dwarf galaxy evolution that is independent of prox
 imity to a massive host.\n\nGraduate students\, please see Gurtina's recent
  paper: \nhttp://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/1201.1299

DESCRIPTION:Titel: VLT imaging of the $\\beta$ Pictoris gas disk\n\nAbstrac
 t: $\\beta$ Pictoris is the only debris disk star in which\ncircumstellar a
 tomic gas has been detected and resolved\, however\, the\ninformation about
  its spatial distribution is limited. Previous\nobservations using slit spe
 ctroscopy has indicated that the\ndistribution of gas emission follows that
  of the dust\, revealing\nintriguing tilts and asymmetries that could sugge
 st dynamical\ninteractions between the disk and planetary bodies. Consideri
 ng\nphotoevaporation time-scales\, the observed gas is probably not\nprimor
 dial\, and a continuous production of atomic gas in the disk\nseems likely.
  In order to better understand the origin of atomic gas\nin the disk of $\\
 beta$ Pic\, we have imaged the gas disk by mapping\nemission lines from Fe 
 I (at 3860 Ã) and Ca II (at 3934 and 3968 Ã)\nusing the fiber facility FLAM
 ES/GIRAFFE at the Very Large Telescope\n(VLT) with the large integral-field
 -unit ARGUS\, producing the first\ncomplete image of Fe I emission\, probin
 g the neutral gas in the disk\nplane\, and Ca II\, probing vertically more 
 extended gas. In this talk I\nwill present the outcome of our observations 
 and also present results\nfrom subsequent abundance modeling using a gas io
 nization code for\ngas-poor debris disks.

DESCRIPTION:Constraints on planet formation from direct imaging\n\nTraditio
 nally\, there have been two main competing theories of planet formation: Co
 re accretion\, in which planets form sequentially through accumulation of a
  solid core followed by accretion of gas onto the core\, and disk instabili
 ty\, in which planets form directly through gravitational collapse in a gas
 eous disk. In this talk\, I will show that by combining direct imaging data
  with the body of observations from radial velocity and transits that have 
 been taken over the past decade\, the issue of which mechanism is the main 
 mode of planet formation can be quantitatively addressed for the first time
 \; and that most likely\, the vast majority of exoplanets form by core accr
 etion. While these arguments can now be made on a population basis\, the fo
 rmation history of individual planetary systems remains a challenging issue
 . I will discuss some such individual systems based on the (often conflicti
 ng) indications of how they might have formed\, and point out ways of resol
 ving these uncertainties in the future.\n\nPaper presented in the talk:\nht

DESCRIPTION:Identifying & Studying Nearby\, Young\, Low-Mass Stars\n\nRecen
 t work has revealed hundreds of young stars (ages <100 Myr) in moving group
 s less than 100 pc from the Earth.\nWe have carried out a search for young\
 , low-mass stars in nearby stellar associations using X-ray and UV source c
 atalogs. We discovered a technique to identify 10-100 Myr-old low-mass star
 s within 100 pc of the Earth using GALEX-optical/near-IR data. Spectroscopi
 c followup has confirmed many of these candidates as young via detection of
  lithium absorption and hydrogen emission lines. We have applied our search
  to the 10 Myr-old TW Hydrae Association\, the nearby Scorpius-Centaurus re
 gion\, and are continuing our search among other nearby moving groups.\n\nI
 f time permits\, I will present results on a young system to illustrate the
  wealth of data one can obtain for such nearby stars. The system is V4046 S
 gr\, a 2-day spectroscopic binary located only 73 pc away. As a member of t
 he ~12 Myr-old beta Pic Moving Group\, V4046 Sgr is one of the oldest known
  classical T Tauri systems. It possesses a rich molecular disk that rivals 
 that of TW Hya\, the archetype of nearby\, isolated classical T Tauri syste
 ms.

DESCRIPTION:Title:\nInsight into Star Formation at the Galactic Center from
  Kinematics of the Young Stellar Disk\n\nAbstract:\nThe Galactic center (GC
 ) contains both a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a collection of young\
 , massive stars\, a seemingly paradoxical combination given our current kno
 wledge of star formation.  Approximately half of these young stars orbit th
 e black hole in a coherent\, clockwise stellar disk.  The dynamics of this 
 young population can be used to constrain theories of star formation in the
  hostile environment of a SMBH. I will present high-precision astrometry (~
 0.1 mas) of ~120 young stars obtained with the Keck telescopes over 16 year
 s\, including seven years of Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics imaging and s
 pectroscopy. Accelerations in the plane of the sky are detected as far out

DESCRIPTION:Detection of Molecular Oxygen in Interstellar Clouds - An Astro
 chemical Dilemma\n\nPaul Goldsmith\nJPL\, California Institute of Technolog
 y\n\nOxygen is the third most abundant element in the cosmos. In the gas ph
 ase\, oxygen can be ionized\, atomic\, or in molecular\, and it is also inc
 orporated into interstellar grains. Models of the gas-phase chemistry in de
 nse clouds predict molecular oxygen (O2) to be almost as abundant as carbon
  monoxide (CO). Searches for Galactic O2 carried out with the SWAS and Odin
  spacecraft have yielded upper limits on the abundance of molecular oxygen 
 typically 2 orders of magnitude below those predicted. The most plausible e
 xplanation is based on depletion of atomic oxygen onto dust grains\, result
 ing in incorporation of this species into water that remains on the grain s
 urface.  Remaining gas-phase oxygen is largely incorporated into CO\, leavi
 ng little for gas-phase O2.  The Herschel Open Time Key Project ``HOPââ (He
 rschel Oxygen Project) addresses this important problem in astrochemistry\,
  exploiting the high angular resolution and sensitivity of the Herschel HIF
 I instrument to observe 3 rotational transitions of O2. We focus on the det
 ection of O2 towards the H2 Peak 1 position near KL in Orion.  This region 
 has several compact molecular sources that have emission at the same veloci
 ty as found for the observed O2 lines and we explore a model based on warmi
 ng grains and restoration of gas phase chemistry that can explain our obser
 vations.  We also discuss low-velocity C-shock models that can produce the 
 observed column density of O2 and conclude with a discussion of some of the
  implications for oxygen chemistry in dense interstellar clouds and the pec
 uliarities of the star forming condensations in Orion.

DESCRIPTION:Empirical Constraints on the Formation and Evolution of Low-Mas
 s Stars and Brown Dwarfs: A Data-Intensive Approach\n\nKeivan Guadalupe Sta
 ssun\, Vanderbilt University \n\nRecent and ongoing large surveys\, both fr
 om the ground and from space\, are enabling new data-intensive approaches t
 o a variety of problems in stellar astrophysics. This talk describes three 
 such projects\, each serving as a vignette of a different but complementary
  mode of data-intensive research into low-mass star formation and evolution
 . The X10000 Project takes a panchromatic\, time-domain approach to study t
 he structures of young stellar coronae in order to understand the role of e
 xtreme coronal mass ejections in the angular momentum evolution of young st
 ars. As a by-product of this work\, we have determined the first robust emp
 irical relationship between X-ray flare energy and coronal mass loss for th
 e Sun. The SLoWPoKES project takes an ensemble\, data-mining approach to ex
 tract from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey the largest sample of wide low-mass
  binaries ever assembled\, which can be used to constrain binary formation 
 theory and for refining the fundamental mass-age-activity-rotation-metallic
 ity relations for low-mass stars. The EB Factory project takes a time-domai
 n\, data-mining approach to identify rare\, but astrophysically very intere
 sting\, case studies from among the large numbers of eclipsing binaries bei
 ng harvested by surveys for transiting exoplanets. We will highlight recent
  discoveries from this work\, and will draw these results together to eluci
 date the physical interrelationships between stellar rotation\, magnetic fi
 eld generation\, and stellar structure during the star-formation process.

DESCRIPTION:FU Orionis outbursts and Transitional disks: What do they tell 
 us about protoplanetary disk accretion and planet formation\n\n  The mechan
 isms and efficiencies of mass transport in accretion disks can be best cons
 trained by studying their time-dependent behavior. By studying FU Orionis o
 bjects\, which are outbursting young protostellar disks\, we constrained th
 e outbursting accretion disk extends to AU scale with the inferred limits o
 n the viscosity parameter alpha~0.02-0.2. By carrying out both analytic stu
 dies and 2-Dimensional radiation hydrodyanmic simulations\, we proposed the
  outburst is due to the thermal activation of the magnetorotational instabi
 lity (MRI) at ~AU scales by the gravitational instability (GI). Extending t
 his work to study protostellar disk long-term evolution\, we found that the
  outbursting behavior of the protostellar disks during the infall phase all
 eviates the so called âluminosity problemâ\, and the layered accretion at t
 he later phase leads to a massive âdead zoneâ where planet formation is fav
 ored.\n   In the second part of my talk\, I will describe â transitional di
 sksâ- protoplanetary disks with gaps and holes and how do they imply young 
 planets in disks. I have studied gap opening by dynamically-interacting mul
 tiple giant planets with 2-Dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. I found th
 at even with as many as four giant planets\, additional substantial dust de
 pletion (e.g. growth) is required to explain these gaps and holes\, which s
 heds light on the early planet formation environment.

DESCRIPTION:I will present spectroscopic data from the Berkeley SuperNova I

 o Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia). The dataset consists of 1298 low-redshift (z<
   0.2) optical spectra of 582 SNe Ia observed from 1989 through the end of 
 2008. Many of the SNe have well-calibrated light curves with measured dista

 amination. I will also describe the spectral classification scheme employed
  (using the SuperNova Identification code\, SNID\; Blondin & Tonry 2007) wh
 ich utilizes a newly constructed set of SNID spectral templates. The sheer 
 size of the BSNIP dataset and the consistency of the observation and reduct

 s. I will also discuss measurements of the spectral features of about one-t
 hird of the spectra which were obtained within 20 days of maximum light. I 
 will briefly describe the adopted method of automated\, robust\nspectral-fe
 ature definition and measurement which expands upon similar previous studie
 s. Comparisons of these measurements of SN Ia spectral features to photomet
 ric observables will be presented with an eye toward using spectral informa
 tion to calculate more accurate cosmological distances. Finally\, I will co

DESCRIPTION:On the Progenitors of Local Type Ia Supernovae\n\nAlthough the 
 basic mechanism responsible for Type Ia supernovae appears to be well under
 stood (thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf that has reac
 hed the Chandrasekhar mass limit)\, the identity of the progenitor system(s
 ) remains a mystery. With implications from stellar evolution to frontline 
 cosmology\, it is critical to attack this problem from every possible angle
 . We present results from our study of three known historical Ia supernovae
  in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) which allow us to begin to eliminate p
 ossible progenitor candidates for at least the local population. We used ar
 chival Hubble Space Telescope images of SNR 0509-67.5\, SNR 0509-68.7\, and
  SNR 0519-69.0 to determine the site of each explosion and then search the 
 surrounding area for potential ex-companion stars left behind. The search w
 as carried out within an error ellipse that accounts for measurement error 
 on the geometric center of the remnant\, the orbital velocity of the pre-su
 pernova binary system\, and kicks from the actual explosion. For SNR 0509-6
 7.5\, the error ellipse is empty to the HST 5-sigma limiting magnitude of V
 =26.9. Using an LMC distance modulus of 18.5\, this implies that any single
  degenerate ex-companion must be fainter than M_V=+8.4 (corresponding appro
 ximately to a K9 main sequence star)\, which eliminates all currently-publi
 shed single-degenerate models\, and leaves us with the conclusion that this
  system had a double-degenerate progenitor.  For SNR 0509-68.7 and SNR 0519
 -69.0\, we can eliminate the possibility of red giant and subgiant ex-compa
 nions. It has been shown that the two confident galactic Ia supernovae (Tyc
 ho's SN 1572 and SN 1006) also do not have red giant ex-companion stars. Co
 mbined with our three systems\, this eliminates the symbiotic progenitor ch
 annel for all of the nearby Ia supernovae.

DESCRIPTION:The Kepler Mission: New Light on Stellar Activity\n\nStellar ma
 gnetic activity leads to observable effects on a range of timescales\, from
  starspots that modulate the stellar brightness on the order of weeks\, to 
 flares\, which release highly energetic radiation over the course of a few 
 hours. Much of our understanding of these phenomena comes from observations
  of the Sun\, where surface spatial resolution and high time cadence afford
  us rich detail unavailable for other stars. The high precision photometry 
 afforded by the Kepler telescope provides a view on stellar astrophysics th
 at has never before been available. Because of the intimate link between st
 ellar rotation and the generation of the magnetic field\, periodic brightne
 ss variations due to starspots may be used to gain insight into the magneti
 c dynamo. In addition\, an understanding of the stellar radiation environme
 nt provides context for studies of potential attendant planets. I will disc
 uss our ongoing work with Kepler to characterize stellar variability due to
  spots\, flares and stellar rotation. \n\n\nReview Material: http://solarph

DESCRIPTION:Title: Magnetorotational Instability Driven Accretion in Protop
 lanetary Disks: Does it Work?\n\nAbstract:\nMagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbu
 lence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) has long been consi
 dered as the most promising mechanism for transporting angular momentum in 
 accretion disks. In protoplanetary disks (PPDs)\, however\, the gas dynamic
 s is strongly affected by non-ideal MHD effects such as Ohmic resistivity\,
  Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD) due to its weak ionization level.
  Most MRI calculations for PPDs done so far consider only the Ohmic resisti
 vity\, while Hall and AD effects dominate the surface and outer regions of 
 PPDs but remain poorly explored. We perform 3D unstratified shearing-box MR
 I simulations with AD using a\nvariety of magnetic field geometries and AD 
 coefficients. We find that angular momentum transport becomes inefficient w
 hen the neutral-ion collision frequency falls below the orbital frequency. 
 Moreover\, sustained MRI turbulence requires weak magnetic field in the AD 
 dominated regime. We present a general framework that incorporate these con
 straints together to predict the MRI-driven accretion rate and the correspo
 nding magnetic field\nstrength in PPDs. Our results indicate that MRI alone
  has difficulty in accounting for the accretion rate in a large fraction of
  PPDs\, while angular momentum transport by magnetized wind may be a viable
  solution. On the other hand\, for transitional disks\, characterized by in
 ner gaps or holes representing a later stage of PPD evolution\, we find tha
 t MRI is able to drive sufficiently rapid accretion consistent with observa
 tions\, and the presence of tiny grains even promotes accretion.

DESCRIPTION:Microlensing Breakthroughs in Planet Discovery\n\nFor the past 
 8 years\, microlensing has been finding planets across the mass spectrum\, 
 from Super Earths to massive Jovian planets. These planets can tell us a lo
 t about planet formation because microlensing is sensitive to planets beyon
 d the snow line\, where giant planets are predicted to form\, and can also 
 find free-floating planets. I will review the planetary systems detected by
  microlensing and the measurement of the frequency of planets beyond the sn
 ow line. I will also discuss the result that free-floating are almost twice
  as common as main sequence stars. Finally\, I will discuss our expectation
 s for future results as we transition into a new era of wide-field microlen
 sing surveys.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Time-domain challenges in the synoptic survey era\n\nAbs
 tract: In extracting scientific insight from the data deluge fostered by ne
 w synoptic surveys\, three broad challenges arise. First\, how can the dive
 rse zoo of variable stars and transients be optimally classified so as to p
 erform demographic studies on aggregate populations? Second\, how can new t
 ypes of (fast-evolving) events be recognized and studied with little human 
 involvement in the real-time loop? Last\, when is it appropriate to use tru
 ly precious discovery resources (e.g.\, LSST) for followup? All of these is
 sues are interconnected and\, I argue\, demanding of new approaches to hand
 ling data and making sense of it. Specific discussions---and our approaches
  with current and past surveys---will revolve around variable star classifi
 cation and quasar identification.

DESCRIPTION:Star Formation from the Radio to Gamma-rays\nTim Paglione York 
 College\, CUNY/AMNH\n\nMassive stars are an important driver of much of gal
 axy evolution. These stars live furiously\, greatly affecting their surroun
 dings with their winds and radiation\, then die dramatically in giant explo
 sions that enrich the interstellar medium in heavy elements. Their lives ar
 e relatively brief as well (âonlyâ 10 million years or less) so their impac
 t is not only profound but immediate. Certain galaxies known as starbursts 
 create numerous clusters of these massive stars in their centers. Starburst
  galaxies may be studied across the entire electromagnetic spectrum\, probi
 ng different physical regions and processes\, but they are traditionally id
 entified by their radio and infrared emission or optical spectroscopy. I au
 gment these studies by including data from a window only recently opened to
  us: gamma-rays. The gamma-ray emission effectively ties together nearly th
 e entire spectrum of a galaxy while elucidating the impact of cosmic rays o

DESCRIPTION:Probing the stellar populations of z ~ 1.5-3.5 galaxies using r
 est-frame UV and optical morphology\n\nNicholas Bond ( Goddard )\n\nI discu
 ss recent work on the properties of the stellar populations of high-redshif
 t galaxies.  We correlate their morphological properties with their spectra
 l energy distributions and use samples of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1.5 
 - 3.5\, including BX\, BzK\, Lyman break galaxies\, and Lyman Alpha Emitter
 s (LAEs) to implement comparative morphological diagnostics to spatially di
 fferentiate the young and old populations of stars. Although the morphologi
 cal differences between rest-frame UV and rest-frame optical light are gene
 rally small\, they are statistically significant for the majority of star-f
 orming galaxies at z >~ 2\, and larger than for early-type galaxies at simi
 lar redshifts. \n\nI then connect this work to LAEs\, which are thought be 
 among the most pristine of the high-redshift galaxies. Despite the common b
 elief that a young\, dust-free environment is needed to produce an LAE\, th
 ere is increasing evidence for an underlying population of older stars in m
 any LAEs\, especially towards lower redshifts (z ~ 2).\n

 \nResults\n\nThe Mars Exploration Rover mission\, now in its seventh year o
 f\noperation at two landing sites\, has acquired more than 170\,000 images 
 with\nthe Panoramic Camera (MER/Pancam) instruments. These high-resolution\
 ,\nmultispectral\, stereoscopic images have enabled new discoveries about t

 images from the Opportunity rover have provided evidence for significant\na
 queous activity in Marsâ past. Astronomical observations with both rovers\n
 have captured solar transits by the martian moons\, Phobos and Deimos\, as\

DESCRIPTION:Migration of rocks\, cores and hurricanes during planet formati
 on\n\nPlanets form in discs of gas and dust around newborn stars. Within th
 ese\ndiscs\, dust grains have to grow 14 orders of magnitude to become\nter
 restrial planets\, or even gas giants like Jupiter. However\, as soon as\na
  disc-like structure is formed\, all its contents are subject to orbital\nm
 igration. Small solids are dragged inwards\, newly formed planets can\neith
 er be pushed into the central star\, or migrate outward to large\ndistances
 . Even structures within the disc migrate. Big\, dust-collecting\nvortices 
 move extremely fast towards the central star. Such a dynamical\nenvironment
  makes it very difficult to relate the population of planets we\nobserve to
 day to the conditions at the time of their formation.

DESCRIPTION:Note: 1/2 hour earlier than usual\n\nOn the interiors of water-
 rich Super-Earths\n\nRoger Fu\nEarth\, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences D
 ept.\, MIT\n\nThe ever-expanding catalog of detected super-Earths calls for
  theoret- ical studies of their properties in the case of a substantial wat
 er layer. Specifically\, geophysical models are needed to infer interior an
 d surface composition and processes based on available observations. Given 
 bulk density\, orbital parameters\, and\, in time\, atmospheric data\, what
  can we say about the planet? How can we be sure it is a water planet at al
 l?\nI will present a set of such models for water planets with a range of m
 asses and water mass fractions (2 â 10 MEarth\, up to 50% H2O). First\, we 
 construct a parametrized convection model for the underlying ice man- tle o
 f higher ice phases\, finding that materials near the silicate-ice interfac
 e should rapidly traverse the ice mantle on the time scale of 0.1 to a hund
 red megayears. Second\, we model the thermal and dynamical structure of the
  near-surface for icy and oceanic surfaces\, finding separate regimes where
  the planet is expected to maintain a surface or subsurface liquid ocean an
 d where it is expected to exhibit ice tectonics. Newly discovered exo- plan
 ets may be placed into one of these regimes given estimates of surface temp
 erature\, heat flux\, and surface gravity. Iâll discuss the implications of
  these internal processes on atmospheric observables\, suggesting the path 
 of future research that will lead to quantitative and testable descriptions
  of water planet atmosphere and surface properties.

DESCRIPTION:How can the baroclinic instability help planet formation?\n\nTu
 rbulence is the main driver of angular momentum transport in accretion disk
 s and major ingredient in planet formation\, be it as transporting and coll
 ecting particles or by generating collisions among larger bodies. So far ma
 gneto-rotational instability (MRI\, Balbus & Hawley\, 1991) was the preferr
 ed way to go. However\, the existence of dead-zones call for a purely hydro
 dynamic instability. The baroclinic instability\, first applied to accretio
 n disks by (Klahr & Bodenheimer\, 2003)\, can fill this void. Under the rig
 ht conditions\, namely correct treatment of cooling/thermal diffusion\,\nst
 rong enough entropy gradient beta_s \, and a non-infinitesimal initial pert
 urbation\,\nit has been shown that baroclinic instability exists in disks (
 Klahr\, 2004\; Lesur & Papaloizou\,\n2010\; Petersen et al.\, 2007a\,b). It
  was already known that vortices can trap dust particles\, which we confirm
  and quantify in our simulations done for particles with Stokes-numbers of 
 1\, 0:05 and 20\, e.g. 1cm to 4m in size at 7:5AU and measure the concentra
 tion factor of dust achieved in this trapping. This will produce important 
 information for collision-speeds among particles as well as for possible gr
 avitational collapse of particle heaps in the framework of gravoturbulent f
 ormation of planetesimals (Johansen et al.\, 2006).

DESCRIPTION:Real estate within 100 parsecs: M dwarf stars for exoplanet sur
 veys and Galactic archaeology.\n\nM dwarf stars are the staple of the Galax
 y. By far the dominant type of hydrogen-burning body\, they also have a kna
 ck for "hiding in plain sight" due to their relatively low luminosities. As
  a result\, the census of M dwarfs has traditionally been very incomplete\,
  even within the neighborhood of the Sun. I will present results from my SU
 PERBLINK survey\, which is now identifying over 90% of all M dwarfs within 
 100 parsecs of the Sun -- over 300\,000 new and/or barely explored objects.
  This new census opens up huge real estate opportunities in the search for 
 exoplanets. I will explain why M dwarfs make such attractive targets for cu
 rrent exoplanet surveys\, particularly in the search for Earth-mass objects
  within a "habitable" zone. In addition\, M dwarfs live such long lives\, t
 hat they hardly change at all over cosmological timescales (>10 billion yea
 rs). I will describe my recent identification of thousands of very old M st
 ars (also known as "M subdwarfs") in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\, and arg
 ue that these true "stellar fossils" hold a major key to understanding the 
 formation and evolution of our Galaxy.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Debris Disk and the Kuiper Belt:  It's All About Collisions\n\n
 \nDebris disks around other stars\, like the disks around Fomalhaut\, Vega\
 ,\nand Epsilon Eridani\, are often described as more massive versions of th
 e\nKuiper Belt. But for a long time\, it's been hard to test this notion\,\
 nbecause grain-grain collisions limit the dust lifetime in debris disks \na
 nd we lacked the tools to model the effect of collisions on the\nappearance
  of the disks. I'll describe a new breakthrough that has allowed\nus to mak
 e 3-D models of collisions in debris disks and exozodiacal clouds\nfor the 
 first time\, and I'll show the latest supercomputer simulations of\nthese s
 ystems\, illustrating the effects of planets and collisions in\nsculpting t
 hese disks.\nThese models will be the key to interpreting debris disk image
 s from HST\,\nHerschel\, SOFIA\, JWST\, and ALMA\, as well as understanding
  the exozodiacal\ndust backgrounds for direct imaging of exo-Earths.

 985\, chemists discovered a very unusual and remarkably stable\nmolecule ma
 de of 60 carbon atoms arranged in a âsoccer ballâ\nstructure: the buckminst
 erfullerene C60 (âbuckyballsâ). It was\nimmediately suggested that these sp
 ecies would form in the outflows of\ncarbon stars\, and survive abundantly 
 in the interstellar\nmedium. However\, in spite of several dedicated search
 es\, conclusive\nevidence for the presence of fullerenes in space has long 
 been\nlacking.\n\nWe recently analyzed the very unusual Spitzer-IRS spectru
 m of the\ncarbon-rich planetary nebula Tc 1\, and concluded that it shows t
 he\nunmistakable signatures of the fullerene species C60 and C70. Since\nth
 en\, fullerenes have been detected in a variety of galactic and\nextragalac
 tic sources\, confirming the presence of these species in\nastrophysical se
 ttings. However\, these detections also include some\nsurprises\, and raise
  several questions about the formation and\nexcitation mechanism(s) of full
 erenes in space\, and about their\noverall distribution and abundance.\n\nI
 n this talk\, I will first present our case for the identification of\nfull
 erenes in Tc 1 and describe the peculiar environment in which we\nfound the
 m. I will then briefly address these open questions and the\npossible impli
 cations for the physics and chemistry of interstellar\nand circumstellar en
 vironments.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The outcome of protoplanetary dust growth: pebbles\, bou
 lders or planetesimals?\n\nAbstract:\nThe evolution of dust particles in pr
 otoplanetary disks determines many observable and structural properties of 
 disks such as the spectral energy distribution (SED)\, scattered light imag
 es of disks\, temperature profile\, chemistry just to name a few. Dust coag
 ulation is also the first step towards planet formation.\n\nFor the first t
 ime\, we collect and compile the recent laboratory experiments on dust aggr
 egates into a collision model that can be implemented into dust coagulation
  models. We put this model into a Monte Carlo code that uses representative
  particles to simulate dust evolution. Simulations are performed in a local
  box (0D) and in a vertical column (1D) of protoplanetary disks. I'll discu
 ss the main results of these simulations. These are the bouncing barrier wh
 ich is another obstacle during the already complex formation process of pla
 netesimals\; and how dust sedimentation is affected by the strength of turb
 ulence\, different porosity and collision models. During the final part of 
 the talk\, I'll discuss how the disk atmospheres can be kept 'dusty' - in s
 pite of dust growth and vertical settling - throughout the lifetime of the 
 disk. This is a long-standing problem of dust evolution in protoplanetary d
 isks.

DESCRIPTION:Data Stream Integration for Modeling Exosystems\n\nThe pace of 
 exoplanet discovery has been steadily accelerating.  New detection methods 
 are progressively mapping out more and more of the parameter space of plane
 tary and orbital characteristics.  Early results from Kepler and plans for 
 future ground-based surveys indicate that future exoplanet databases will p
 rovide us with detailed statistics on many different planet types.  Given t
 he expectation that future databases will include many different observatio
 ns of the same targets\, it is useful to consider how these varying data st
 reams may interact.  If we assume that any data gathered about an extra-sol
 ar planetary system (exosystem) is a partial observation of a single underl
 ying system\, then all observations can be used to construct a unified exos
 ystem model.  To do so\, we must treat data streams as partial observations
  of a Markov process\, governed by the known laws of gravity and optics\, a
 nd relate them to a common parameter set.  We also need to accurately quant
 ify the error of the measurement.  I present a candidate parameter set suit
 able for multiple observing techniques used today and a method for incorpor
 ating observations into a common exosystem model.  Priors for the exosystem
  state are calculated from known exoplanet statistics\, and multiple method
 s are considered for calculating posterior parameter distributions given ne
 w observations.

DESCRIPTION:PAH emission features as astrophysical probes\n\nThe infrared (
 IR) spectra of many galactic and extragalactic objects are\ndominated by em
 ission features at 3.3\, 6.2\, 7.7\, 8.6 and 11.2 micron\, the\nso-called u
 nidentified infrared (UIR) bands. These bands are now generally\nattributed
  to the IR fluorescence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon molecules\n(PAHs
 ) and closely related species. It is now firmly established that\nthe detai
 led\ncharacteristics of the PAH bands exhibit significant variability in\ni
 ntensities and\nprofiles and that these variations depend on the object typ
 e\, the (hardness of\nthe) radiation field\, the electron density\, the eff
 ective temperature\nand the type\nof environment (i.e. circumstellar versus
  interstellar medium).\nHowever\, from the\nmolecular spectroscopy point of
  view\, intrinsic spectra of PAH molecules are\ndetermined by their charge 
 state\, size\, precise molecular (edge) structure\, and\ntheir temperature 
 (vibrational energy content). Thus\, the observed variations\nin the PAH ba
 nds are controlled by both the local physical conditions and the\nconstitue
 nts of the PAH population. Hence\, underpinning of these observations\nwith
  laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations of spectra from PAHs\
 nand related species is a fundamental necessity in order to allow exploitat
 ion of\nthese features as astrophysical probes.\nHere\, I will highlight th
 e spectral characteristics of PAHs in space\nand the recent\nadvances made 
 by comparison of the astronomical PAH spectra with laboratory\nexperiments 
 and theoretical calculations of PAH spectra.

DESCRIPTION:Maryam Modjaz / Columbia\n\nStellar Forensics with Explosions: 
 Supernovae\, Gamma-Ray Bursts\, and their Environments\n\nLong-duration gam
 ma-ray bursts (GRBs) and Type Ib/c Supernovae (SN\nIb/c) are two of nature'
 s most magnificent explosions from massive\nstars. While GRBs launch relati
 vistic jets\, SN Ib/c are core-collapse\nexplosions whose progenitors have 
 been stripped of their hydrogen and\nhelium envelopes. Yet for over a decad
 e\, one of the key outstanding\nquestions is what conditions lead to each k
 ind of explosion in massive\nstripped stars. Determining the fates of massi
 ve stars is not only a\nvibrant topic in itself\, but also impacts using GR
 Bs as star formation\nindicators over distances up to 13 billion light-year
 s and for mapping\nthe chemical enrichment history of the universe.\n\nI wi
 ll present a number of comprehensive observational studies that\nprobe the 
 SN progenitor environments\, their metallicities and the\nexplosion geometr
 ies of SN with and without GRBs. Furthermore\, I will\ndiscuss SN 2008D\, w
 hich was discovered serendipitously with the NASA\nSwift satellite via its 
 X-ray emission from shock breakout. It\ngenerated great interest amongst bo
 th observers and theorists and\nillustrates a novel technique for stellar f
 orensics. I will conclude\nwith an outlook on how the most promising venues
  of research - using current \nand upcoming large-area transient surveys su
 ch as PTF and LSST - will shed \nnew light on the diverse deaths of massive
  stars.

DESCRIPTION:The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observed spectra for tens o
 f thousands\nof cool\, low-mass stars. The spectra cover the range about 39
 00 A to \n9500 A at moderate resolution and can be used to identify stars o
 f\nall spectral types and to measure radial velocities\, chemical abundance
 s\nand emission-line activity. Many stars have multiple spectroscopic\nobse
 rvations\, and candidate close binary stars (dM/dM and dM/WD) \ncan be iden
 tified.  The spectra are taken as a succession of 15-minute\nexposures. The
  individual 15-minute exposures have now been fully\ncalibrated and reduced
 \, and provide information on rapid variability.\nI will discuss results fr
 om several samples of cool dwarfs extracted from \nthe SDSS spectroscopic d

 9 dwarfs\, and hundreds of dwarf carbon and \ncool subdwarf stars. These re

 measured by emission in the H-alpha\nline\, with the activity rising from a
  few percent for late K stars\nto essentially 100% at about M4\, where thes
 e stars become fully convective\,\nand then declining again for spectral ty
 pes M8 and later\; t\ndiscovery of many close binaries\, dM/dM and dM/WD\; 
 the measurement\nof greatly enhanced chromospheric activity in early dM sta
 rs with\nclose WD companions\, very likely due to the spin-up of the dM sta
 r\;\nthe timescales for variability in the chromospheric emission lines\;\n
 a possible lower limit to the masses of dwarf carbon stars\; and\n(probable

DESCRIPTION:The nature of Turbulence in Circumstellar disks:  Magnetorotati
 onal and Baroclinic Instability.\n\nTurbulence in circumstellar disks diffu
 ses small solid material\, leads to collisions among larger objects\, conce
 ntrates boulders promoting planetesimal formation via gravity and also has 
 an impact on planet migration.  Despite the importance of turbulence\, its 
 nature is not completely understood so far. In certain regions of the disk 
 the gas is sufficiently ionized for Magneto-Hydrodynamics to lead to turbul
 ence. Other regions being too cold or dusty could now either be dead zones 
 without turbulence or develop a different kind of instability.  Realistic r
 adial entropy gradients and thermal diffusion times in typical accretion di
 sks around young stars can lead to baroclinic instability and the formation
  of vortices and the generation of turbulent viscosity.  I summarize the st
 ate of field of baroclinic instability in accretion disks and show latest r

DESCRIPTION:The effects of stochastic forces on planetary systems and Satur
 n's rings\n\nThe increasing number of discovered extra-solar planets opens 
 a new opportunity for studying the formation of planetary systems. Their di
 versity keeps challenging long-standing theories which were primarily based
  on data from our own solar system. Resonant planetary systems are of parti
 cular interest because their dynamical configuration provides very strong c
 onstraints on the otherwise unobservable phase of formation and migration. 
 \n\nProto-planets are exposed to stochastic forces\, generated by density f
 luctuations in a turbulent disc. This can be modelled analytically for both
  a single planet\, and two planets in mean motion resonance. Applying this 
 model to the GJ876 system shows that most planetary systems are stable for 
 reasonable strengths of the stochastic forces\, but systems with lighter pl
 anets can get disrupted. Even if a resonance is not completely disrupted\, 
 stochastic forces create characteristic\, observable libration patterns - s
 uch as in the system HD128311. \n\nAs a further application\, the stochasti
 c migration of small bodies in Saturnâs rings is presented. Analytic predic
 tions of collisional and gravitational interactions of a moonlet with ring 
 particles are compared to realistic three dimensional collisional N-body si
 mulations with up to a million particles. The migration of the moonlet is f
 ast enough to be directly observable by the Cassini spacecraft.\n\nI will a
 lso present recent hydrodynamical simulations of proto-planetary discs with
  embedded planets\, resembling the resonant planetary system HD45364. The r
 esults provide strong evidence that the proto-planetary disc must be very m
 assive\, with a surface density much larger than previously thought.

DESCRIPTION:itle:  "Cool\, Young and Energetic:  A Hunt for the Young `Miss
 ing' M dwarfs for Direct Imaging Searches of Planets and Disks"\n\n\nKnown 
 young M dwarfs have been intensively targeted with ground-based and space-b
 ased telescopes at many wavelengths to scrutinize their planet-forming stat
 us (e.g.\, circumstellar disk properties and accretion diagnostics)\, inclu
 ding high-contrast exoplanet imaging programs. Finding more young M dwarfs 
 close to Earth is critical.\n\nStellar activity is a well-established indic
 ator of youth\, making all-sky X-ray and UV surveys well-suited for finding
  young stars. However\, since the X-ray luminosities of M dwarfs are 10â300
 x lower than solar-type stars\, the ROSAT catalogs are generally limited to
  the nearest\, earliest-type stars. By scrutinizing the GALEX/UV properties
  of the 25-pc sample\, we have constructed efficient selection criteria to 
 expand the search by a factor of 4 in distance. In addition to the 64 times
  increase in volume\, the larger distance probes regions populated by the y
 oungest known moving groups\, including the archetype ~10 Myrâold TW Hydrae
  Association (TWA). We demonstrate this capability by combining the GALEX A
 ll-sky Imaging Survey with existing photometric catalogs to identify 16 can
 didate members of TWA. High-resolution spectra confirms 2 new mid-M TWA mem
 bers and the first accreting low-mass member of 16-Myr old Lower Centaurus 
 Crux. All 3 are excellent targets for direct imaging searches for substella
 r companions and circumstellar disks.

 hed for early-type galaxies having a supermassive BH ($10^7-10^{10}$\\MSUN)
  in their centers. The extrapolation of this relation to the lower BH-mass 
 regime is strongly dependent on the existence of BHs in the mass range of $
 10^3-10^6$\\MSUN\\ -- called the ``intermediate-mass" black hole (IMBH). Th
 e BH-mass versus velocity dispersion relation infers the existence of IMBHs
  in dense stellar environments having dispersion in the range of 20-100km/s
 . Dwarf galaxies are well known to have central velocity dispersions in thi
 s range making them ideal candidates for hosting an IMBH. In this talk\, I 
 will present an ambitious project for the search of IMBHs using the Souther
 n African Large Telescope (SALT). In particular\, the results of a pilot st
 udy in the search of these objects at the center of nearby dwarf galaxies u
 sing the SALT spectrograph will be shown. Even though the presence of an IM
 BH in the galaxy center remains inconclusive with the current data\, these 
 results do however give a great deal of insight into the capabilities and l
 imitations of SALT in our search for the elusive IMBH.

 cold phases and the interruption of that balance by the explosion of stars 
 in supernovae. I will show new results enabled by the GALFA-HI survey that 
 throw these standard theoretical underpinnings into disarray. I will discus
 s our investigation of the nearest cold neutral medium (CNM) to the sun\, d
 eep within the boundaries of the local cavity. High spectral resolution obs
 ervations of this object present interesting constraints to theorists and s
 imulators who propose that CNM clouds are formed by the collision of warmer
  clouds. Observations of the absorption of soft X-rays by this CNM show tha
 t X-rays emanate much nearer to the sun than was thought before\, casting d
 oubt on the local hot bubble theory. We have also investigated hundreds of 
 compact HI clouds in our Galaxy\, many of which seem to be in extreme force
  imbalance with the expected ambient ISM. These finding all suggest we have
  much to learn about the Galactic ISM we call home.

 System?\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe recent discovery of Main Belt Comets (MBCs) pre
 sents a new puzzle concerning the beginnings of the Solar System. As the na
 me indicates\, these objects exhibit dual characteristics: physically\, the
 y appear and behave like comets\, while dynamically they resemble asteroids
 \, residing in the main asteroid belt in stable orbits of low eccentricity.
  The prevailing concept that comets and asteroids are distinct classes of o
 bjects\, the former ice-rich\nand the latter ice-poor\, is thus severely ch
 allenged. Four such objects have been discovered in recent years\, but more
  are expected to be detected by ongoining observational surveys devoted to 
 this new and mysterious population.\n\nWhether MBCs were formed in their pr
 esent location or captured from more distant regions during the early bomba
 rdment era is still debated\; either way\, they have spent most of their li
 fetimes in the main belt\, which has been considered too hot for ice to sur
 vive for any length of time. The questions addressed in this talk are: (a) 
 To what extent and under what conditions (related to structure and composit
 ion) may water ice be preserved in MBCs for the age of the Solar System? (b
 ) May other volatiles be preserved as well? (c) How deep below the surface 
 is the ice expected to be found? If ice is found to be present in MBCs in l
 arge abundance\, this may help in solving the puzzle of the origin of Earth
 's water.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  \nNearby Young Moving Groups:  Low-Mass Members Reveale
 d\n\nAbstract:\nYoung stars exist near the Sun in loose associations with e
 ach constituent having a common motion through the galaxy\, hence the name 
 nearby young moving groups (NYMGs).  Most known members of NYMGs are of spe
 ctral type F\, G and K\, thus\, we have begun a program to identify the elu
 sive\, low-mass\, M-type members of these groups using a proper motion sele
 ction algorithm and several observational techniques. We have three goals: 
 1) To provide high priority targets for exoplanet searches by direct imagin
 g\, 2) To complete the census of the membership in the NYMGs down to ~0.1 M
 sun\, and thus 3) Provide a well-characterized sample of nearby (10-100 pc)
 \, young (8-50 Myr) stars for detailed study of their physical and kinemati
 c properties. Our program proceeds as follows: we apply the selection algor
 ithm to a proper motion catalog where initial selection cuts of candidate m
 embers are based on the mean motion of known NYMG members and the proper mo
 tions and estimated distances of the candidates. NYMG membership is investi
 gated further using signatures of youth\, including HÎ± emission and X-ray ï¬
 ux\, and then verified through radial velocity measurements.  Thus far\, ou
 r program has identified 28 likely new low-mass members of the Beta Pictori
 s and AB Doradus moving groups\, including several binary systems.  \n

DESCRIPTION:Title: New Developments in Spiral Structure Theory\nAbstract: A
 fter a short review of the principal theories of spiral structure in galaxi
 es\, I describe two new developments. First\, it now seems clear that linea
 r theory cannot yield a full description for the development of spiral patt
 erns because N-body simulations suggest that non-linear effects manifest th
 emselves at a relative overdensity of ~2%\, which is well below the believe
 d spiral amplitudes in galaxies. Second\, I summarize the evidence that som
 e stars in the solar neighborhood have been scattered at an inner Lindblad 
 resonance. This evidence strongly supports a picture of spirals as a recurr
 ing cycle of transient instabilities\, each caused by resonant scattering b
 y a previous wave.

 98%). Two have projected physical separations less than 1.5 AU. This may in

DESCRIPTION:Title: Disc Fragmentation around Primordial Stars\nAbstract: Th
 e formation of the first stars in dark matter minihalos has been well studi
 ed\, and it is now possible to follow the evolution of the baryons all the 
 way up to protostellar densities. In our present study we shift our focus t
 o somewhat lower densities\, aiming to capture the evolution of the infalli
 ng gas over several thousand years. Using sink particles\, we can replace t
 he gravitationally bound gas at densities higher than 1e15 cm^-3 and radii 
 greater than 4 AU from the central protostellar core\, with an accreting po
 int mass that is able to gravitationally interact with the surrounding gas.
  This enables us to capture the formation of the discs around primordial st
 ars for the first time. We study in detail the early stages of the subseque
 nt disc buildup\, showing that\, after several hundred years\, the disc bec
 omes gravitationally unstable. Furthermore\, it becomes sufficiently extend
 ed that the cooling time is eventually shorter than the orbital period\, su
 ch that the `Gammie Criteria' are satisfied and the disc can fragment. We h
 ave also investigated the effect on the disc of the accretion luminosity of
  the central protostar\, and show that although this has a clear effect on 
 the disc structure\, it is unable to prevent fragmentation. We therefore pr
 edict that the first stars in the universe formed as binaries\, rather than
  as single stars.

DESCRIPTION:Title:  New Insight on the Origin of Blue Stragglers\n\nAbstrac
 t:  Globular and open clusters are important sites for the study of stellar
 \npopulations.  Among other things\, star clusters are relatively isolated\
 nfrom the rest of the Galaxy\, they have a narrow range of stellar ages\nan
 d they act as birth sites for most of the stars in our Galaxy.\nDynamical e
 ncounters are thought to play a crucial role in driving\nstar cluster evolu

 ous types of stellar exotica.  Blue straggler\nstars are a particularly int
 eresting example of such exotic stellar\npopulations\, appearing as an exte
 nsion of the main-sequence turn-off in\ncolor-magnitude diagrams.  Though t
 he precise role played by dynamics\nin creating blue stragglers is still de
 bated\, these curious stars offer\npotentially crucial insight into the evo
 lution of star clusters.  On\nthe observational front\, a number of recent 
 results have provided\nexciting new constraints for entire populations of b
 lue stragglers.  We\ndiscuss the theoretical implications of these new resu
 lts for blue\nstraggler production and the precise role that dynamical enco
 unters are\nthought to have played\, in particular interactions between mul
 tiple\nstar systems.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Ionization Feedback in Massive Star Formation\nAbstract:
  Understanding the origin of high-mass stars is central to modern astrophys
 ics. We shed light on this problem using novel radiation-hydrodynamic simul
 ations that consistently follow the gravitational collapse of a massive mol
 ecular cloud\, the subsequent build-up and fragmentation of the accretion d
 isk surrounding the nascent star\, and\, for the first time\, the interacti
 on between its intense UV radiation field and the infalling material. We sh
 ow that ionization feedback can neither stop protostellar mass growth nor s
 uppress fragmentation. We present a consistent picture of the formation and
  evolution of HII regions that explains the observed morphology\, time vari
 ability\, and ages of ultracompact HII regions\, solving the long-standing 
 lifetime problem.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Warm Ionized Gas in the Galaxy\nAbstract: The warm ioniz
 ed medium (WIM) is a major component of the interstellar medium of galaxies
 \, with much of the H^+ mass in the Galaxy located hundreds of parsecs from
  the OB stars that ionize it. Most of the information about the physical co
 nditions in the WIM comes from faint optical emission lines\, primarily H-a
 lpha\, [N II]\, and [S II]\, observed with Fabry-Perot spectrometers like t
 he Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM). Above the plane\, high velocity clouds 
 have a considerable ionized component. One cloud in particular\, the Smith 
 Cloud\, shows evidence of interaction with the ISM. WHAM data provide the f
 irst metallicity estimate\, suggesting that the cloud is new material accre
 ting onto the Galaxy. After a successful 12 year run on Kitt Peak\, WHAM is
  now operating at Cerro Tololo\, Chile to complete an all sky\, kinematical
 ly resolved survey of H-alpha emission. In an analysis of the WHAM Northern
  Sky Survey\, we have found that the distribution of H-alpha emission measu
 res from the WIM is consistent with pervasive isothermal turbulence. While 
 visiting AMNH\, I am working to further interpret these results in the cont
 ext of a multi-phase\, supernova-driven Galactic ISM.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Stellar Multiplicity and Planet Formation\n\nAbstract: I
  will describe several recently-completed observational programs to study y
 oung stars with a range of high-resolution imaging techniques\, including l
 aser guide star adaptive optics imaging and nonredundant aperture-mask inte
 rferometry. My results indicate that many of our previous ideas about multi
 plicity and planet formation were incorrect or incomplete. The primordial b
 inary star population for solar-type stars appears significantly different 
 from the field population\, and the mass dependence of binary properties is
  even more pronounced than had been previously appreciated. I am also placi
 ng significant constraints on the frequency and properties of giant planets
  in outer solar systems (a=5-40 AU). This indicates either that the populat
 ion parameters (frequency and separation/mass functions) suggested by RV su
 rveys are wrong\, or that the expected fluxes are indeed fainter than older
  models predicted. Finally\, I have found that close stellar companions can
  significantly influence the evolution and lifetime of protoplanetary disks
 . Some of the "transitional disks" (disks with gaps or inner holes) that ha
 ve been suggested as sites of ongoing planet formation are instead being cl
 eared by close binary companions\, and most of the youngest (<2 Myr) stars 
 without disks appear to be close binary systems where this clearing process
  has already finished.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Revealing the Galaxies Traced by 77\,000 SDSS Quasar Sig
 ht Lines\nAbstract: Owing to the advent of large spectroscopic surveys such
  as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\, tens of thousands of quasar absor
 ption line systems have been identified to date. Absorber catalogs now exte
 nd to z ~ 4.6 and provide unique probes of the large scale structure of bar
 yonic matter in the high-redshift universe\; yet many critical questions re
 garding the origins and environments of these absorbers persist.  Metal abs
 orption along the line of sight to quasars is believed to probe a wide vari
 ety of physical processes\, including relativistic quasar outflows\, star-f
 orming regions in foreground galactic disks\, and virialized gas in extende
 d galactic haloes.  Although progress has been made in observationally diff
 erentiating the physical phenomena producing absorption in individual syste
 ms\, high-resolution spectroscopy is generally required for such work. Only
  recently has the vast dataset of the SDSS provided the means to disentangl
 e some observational degeneracies in quasar absorption line studies statist
 ically\, with its large samples of medium resolution data.  I will present 
 results from cross-correlations of SDSS galaxies with the largest multi-ion
  absorber catalog compiled to date\, which indicate that the strongest Mg I
 I absorption features can be used to trace actively star-forming galaxies t
 o at least z~1.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Type III Migration in a Low Viscosity Disc\nAbstract: We
  present studies of the interaction of a Saturn-mass planet with a massive 
 gaseous disc. In this regime of planet and disc mass\, the planet can chang
 e its orbital semi-major axis due to the exchange of angular momentum with 
 material that crosses the planet's orbital radius. This is commonly known a
 s type III or runaway migration. We focus on low viscosity discs. We show t
 hat thin vortensity rings form as a result of shocks induced by the planet 
 potential\, and the shocks extend close to the planet's orbital radius. The
  stability of such vortensity rings is analysed and found to be dynamically
  unstable. The unstable modes are focused around vortensity (the curl of th
 e disc's velocity field divided by its surface density) minima. Numerical s
 imulations show they develop into large-scale vortices in the non-linear re
 gime. These vortices are found to scatter the planet inwards\, resulting in
  non-smooth type III migration in low viscosity discs.

 energy\, yet\ncurrent reconstructions of the dark energy equation of state 
 are limited\nby systematic uncertainties in SN Ia luminosities.  The progen
 itors\,\nexplosion mechanisms and environments of SNe Ia are still not defi
 nitively\nknown\; a more complete understanding of SN Ia physics can guide 
 and inform\ninvestigations of astrophysical systematics in cosmological ana
 lyses.  The\nNearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory) ran a five-year "blind" s
 earch for\nSNe Ia covering 20\,000 deg^2\, which discovered a number of unu
 sual SNe Ia\nin faint\, star-forming host galaxies not covered by contempor
 ary\n"targeted" searches.  These discoveries have signicantly expanded the\
 nobserved range of possible photometric and spectroscopic behavior in SNe\n
 Ia.  I will discuss some recent and ongoing efforts within SNfactory to\nun
 derstand the physics of peculiar SN Ia explosions\, in particular the\nover
 luminous CSM-interacting SNe 2002ic and 2005gj\, and the\nsuper-Chandrasekh
 ar-mass SN Ia 2007if.  Such peculiar SNe Ia also have the\npotential to rev
 eal similar physics at work\, though at less extreme\nlevels\, in subclasse
 s of apparently normal SNe Ia.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Turbulent Birth of Planets\nAbstract: The ill fate o
 f the building blocks of planets in gaseous disks around young stars stands
  as one of the major unsolved problems in the theory of planet formation. O
 ur current level of understanding indicates that solids in circumstellar di
 sks migrate into the star or are destroyed in collisions on timescales that
  are much too short to allow the assembly of kilometer sized bodies that ca

  most recent models rely on turbulent motions in the disk in order to breac

DESCRIPTION:Title: Tidal Heating Models for the Radii of Inflated Transitin
 g Extrasolar Giant Planets\nAbstract: The more than 60 transiting extrasola

  and improve the models of the structure and evolution of these bodies. The
 ir mass and radius are inferred from a combination of radial velocity and t
 ransit lightcurve measurements that break the planet mass-inclination angle
  degeneracy. It turns out that some transiting EGPs have measured radii lar
 ger than predicted by the standard theory\, which suggests the presence of 
 an additional heat-source in the interiors of these "inflated planets."\nIn
  this talk\, I will present two tidal-heating scenarios that might explain 
 this puzzle for many of the inflated EGPs.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Cassini at Saturn: Sources and Dynamic of Planetary Gas 
 Tori\nAbstract: The Cassini spacecraft entered into orbit about Saturn in J
 uly 2004 initiating a four-year study which was extended for two years with
  an additional eight years likely. During orbit insertion\, Cassini made it
 s closest encounter with Saturnâs main rings\, detecting a toriodal oxygen 
 atmosphere. In January 2005 the Huygens probe penetrated Titanâs dense atmo
 sphere and successfully landed on its surface. In August 2009 Saturn recent
 ly passed through equinox allowing observations of the vertical structure o
 f its main rings. Cassini has made numerous passes through Titanâs upper at
 mosphere\, has made close encounters with many of its icy moons\, especiall
 y the active moon Enceladus\, and has mapped Saturnâs magnetosphere. Molecu
 les ejected from Saturnâs rings and icy satellites and from Titanâs atmosph
 ere produce giant gas tori in Saturnâs magnetosphere. The origins and dynam
 ics of these toroidal atmospheres and the role of the magnetosphere in redi
 stributing material will be described. It is found\, for instance\, that th
 ese toriodal atmospheres are source of oxygen for the upper atmospheres of 
 Saturn and Titan. Such tori have been seen at Juptier and Neptune and may e
 ventually be detected around extrasolar giant planets indicative of the pre
 sence of rings or satellites.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:  The formation of a solar system such as ours is beli
 eved to have followed a four stage process around a protostar and its assoc
 iated accretion disk.  However\, as first noted by Whipple and later calcul
 ated by Weidenschilling\, planetesimal growth by particle agglomeration is 
 strongly influenced by gas drag\; there is a ``bottleneck'' at  the meter s
 cale with such bodies rapidly spiraling into the central star\, whereas muc
 h smaller or larger particles do not.  Thus\, successful planetary accretio
 n requires rapid planetesimal growth to km scale.  The commonly accepted pi
 cture is that above a certain threshold collisional velocity\, V_TH\, parti
 cle agglomeration is not possible\; elastic rebound overcomes attractive su
 rface and intermolecular forces.  However\, if perfect sticking is {\\em as
 sumed}  for all ranges of interparticle collision speeds the bottleneck can
  be overcome by rapid planetesimal growth.\nWhile previous work has dealt e
 xplicitly with the influences of collisional pressures and the possibility 
 of particle fracture\, the basic role of the phase behavior of matter--phas
 e diagrams\, amorphs and polymorphs--has been neglected.  \nHere it is demo
 nstrated that\, under conditions in solar nebula\, novel aspects of surface
  phase transitions (melting\, amorphs and polymorphs)\, extend the range of
  primary accretion by providing a physical basis for efficient sticking thr
 ough collisional melting or amphorph-/polymorphization and fusion at V_c >>
   V_TH.  Therefore\, as inspiraling meter sized bodies collide with smaller
  particles\, there is a regime in which collisional fusion allows them to g
 row rapidly to km scales and hence settle into Keplerian orbits.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:  GGD 37 (Cepheus A West) is a collection of Herbig Ha
 ro objects -- small emission nebulae that signify the interaction between b
 oth broad and collimated outflows from young stellar objects and the ambien
 t molecular cloud material.  Although it has been well-studied at millimete
 r and longer wavelengths\, the relationship of this flow to its companion C
 epheus A East is not well understood.  The Outflows GO program utilized the
  Spitzer Space Telescope to map several outflow regions\, including GGD 37 
 in the mid-infrared.  With this data we have spatially resolved weaker shoc
 ks (less than ~ 10000 K) that excite the molecular hydrogen into various ro
 tational states detectable at IRS wavelengths\, from strong shocks that com
 pletely destroy the molecules and illuminate the ions.  The dataset contain
 s a rich array of chemical species\, allowing us to analyze the energetics 
 of a multi-phase shock as it impacts the surrounding molecular cloud.  How 
 does the instability of driving sources of Herbig Haro jets affect their su
 rrounding medium?  By studying the pre-and post-shock gas\, we can determin
 e whether outflows from young stars have greater clumping or dispersive eff
 ects on their environment.  Do outflows trigger or suppress star formation 
 in the neighborhood?  We present evidence that powerful flows such as HH 16
 8 can unbind a protostar in its early stages of development\, opening a 100
 00 AU cavity of ionized material.  We provide evidence that the progenitor 
 source of the HH 168 flow is at the radio source W2\, rather than the more 
 distant HW3c\, and is among the hottest and most intense protostellar outfl
 ows.  As a result we may have the opportunity to observe a high mass protos
 tar in its initial stages of formation.

DESCRIPTION:Title: From Cores to Disks: instability and multiplicity\nAbstr
 act: In the early phases of star formation\, protostellar disks accrete mat
 erial rapidly from an envelope of gas and dust. When the Mach number of the
  infalling material becomes large\, disks can no longer funnel all of the g
 as down onto the central star. This causes the disk mass to increase until 
 self-gravity comes to dominate angular momentum transport.  To better under
 stand the evolution of these   unstable systems\, we have combined theoreti
 cal disk models with three dimensional global AMR simulations to carry out 
 a parameter space study of rapidly accreting disks. We show that one can pr
 edict disk behavior and the   multiplicity of the accreting star system as 
 a function of two dimensionless parameters which compare the diskâs accreti
 on rate to its sound speed and orbital period. We also conï¬rm the existence
  of a maximum stable disk mass: disks that exceed â¼ 50% of the total system
  mass are subject to fragmentation and the subsequent formation of binary c
 ompanions.\n

DESCRIPTION:Title: Feeding black holes through galaxy mergers: the clusteri
 ng of simulated quasars and the "merger bias"\nAbstract: Different physical
  processes such as major/minor mergers\, disk\ninstabilities\, or stellar m
 ass loss\, can trigger black hole accretion and AGN activity by channeling 
 gas towards galaxy centers\, and these feeding modes are expected to show d
 ifferences in their dependence on environment and redshift. Using semi-anal
 ytical models for galaxy formation applied to the outputs of the Millennium
  Simulation\, we predicted the clustering properties of quasars triggered b
 y mergers and the good agreement with the most recent data of quasar cluste
 ring seem to lead support to the conjecture that galaxy mergers could be th
 e main physical process responsible for triggering black hole accretion and
  quasar activity. We also explored the significance of the "merger bias" on
  quasar clustering using both semi-analytical models and simulations\, and 
  I will discuss the implications of this effect  on the assumptions of merg
 er-driven quasar activity.

DESCRIPTION:Title: Neutron Star Spins: in isolation and with companions\nAb
 stract: How fast Neutron Stars (NSs) spin at birth? Radio studies have addr
 essed the issue for decades\, often yielding wildly different results.  Her
 e I will discuss the results of a new method\, based on X-ray observations\
 , which suggest that the majority of NSs are born as slow rotators.\nWhile 
 isolated NSs can only spin down\, accreting X-ray binaries display a wide r
 ange of behaviours.  Some of them are observed to spin up steadily\, others
  to alternate between spin-up and spin-down states\, sometimes superimposed
  on a longer trend of either spin up or spin down. I will discuss how this 
 rich phenomenology can be interpreted within a new\, simple model of the di
 sk-magnetosphere interaction. This model\, based on a purely material torqu
 e\, does not require external perturbations to induce the torque reversals.
   I will specifically illustrate the model in the cases of the X-ray binari
 es GX 1+4 and 4U 1626-67.

 out in the MPIA theory group. After a general overview I will focus on thre
 e fields:\n1.) The global baroclinic instability: Disks with a radial entro

  are subject to radial migration. Non-isothermal disks can produce radially
  outward migration for small planets (~<30) Mearth. We present latest resul
 ts from 3D radiation hydro models.\n3.) Disk Fragmentation planets: We argu
 e that several of the recently detected direct imaging planets are the resu
 lt of a disk fragmentation. In particular we discuss GQ Lupi\, Formalhaut a
 nd HR8799.

DESCRIPTION:Current models of Type Ia supernova show that the thermonuclear
  explosion of a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf can largely explain observat
 ions. However\, many uncertainties remain in this model. The thermonuclear 
 burning begins at a flame near the center of the white dwarf\, but the spat
 ial and temporal distribution of the initial flames can greatly affect the 
 explosion outcome. To understand how a Type Ia supernova explosion begins r
 equires understanding the centuries-long convective phase preceeding the ex
 plosion. Modeling convection for 10s-100s of turnover times requires algori
 thms tuned for longtime integration.  In this talk\, I will discuss our alg
 orithmic approach--low Mach number hydrodynamics\, and present three-dimens
 ional calculations of the final hours of the convective phase.  I will conc
 lude by discussing what these calculations\ntell us about ignition and the 
 subsequent explosion.

 namics in galactic disks\, using the recent Galactic plane 13CO survey data

 detect many GMCs both on spiral arms and in interarm regions. Associations 
 of giant molecular clouds (GMAs) are found only on spiral arms\, and thus\,
  they are unbound\, short-lived structures\, being broken up across spiral 
 arms. Molecular gas fraction is high even in interarm regions\; therefore\,
  the GMA destruction is not caused by stellar feedback\, which likely destr
 oy molecules as well as GMAs and GMCs. I will discuss dynamically-driven GM
 C evolution -- strong shear motions in spiral arms cause GMA destruction an

 The Early Stages of Planet Formation"\n\nAbstract: \nThe fast-paced discove
 ry of extrasolar planets has heightened interest in the mechanisms by which
  planets form. The early stages of planet formation -- growth from dust gra
 ins to "planetesimals" larger than a kilometer -- is a long-standing proble
 m which sets the stage for subsequent growth phases. Simple growth by colli
 sional sticking stalls as collisions become more violent with increasing pa
 rticle size. The gravitational collapse of many small solids into a larger 
 planetesimal is a promising mechanism. However stirring of particles by tur
 bulent gas opposes this collapse\, and led to the abandonment of the hypoth
 esis. I will describe recent dynamical work which is resurrecting the colla
 pse mechanism for planetesimal formation. A key point is that turbulence no
 t only stirs particles but creates transient clumps\, which can act as seed
 s for gravitational collapse.  The streaming instability provides a robust 
 mechanism for drag forces to promote particle clumping (Youdin & Goodman\, 
 2005\; Youdin & Johansen\, Johansen & Youdin 2007). Simulations by Johansen
  et al. (2007\, Nature) confirm the viability of the collapse hypothesis wh
 en initial particle sizes are above tens of centimeters. I will describe on
 going analytic work on gravitational collapse which can be extrapolated acr
 oss parameter space\, including toward smaller particle sizes. A surprising
  and robust conclusion is that planetesimals can form with initial sizes si
 gnificantly larger than the canonical value of a few km. I will describe im
 plications both for the detailed properties of our Solar System\, and for t
 he formation of planets and exoplanets in general.

DESCRIPTION:Title: "Two Puzzles Posed by X-ray Clusters"\n\nAbstract: \nClu
 ster galaxies swim in a sea of 100 million degree gas.   This gas\, identif
 ied by its X-ray emission in the 1970's\, was the third of the three primar
 y components of clusters to be discovered (dark matter being first identifi
 ed by Zwicky in the 30's).    Although clusters are simple in some respects
  (e.g. ideal gas\, optically thin X-ray emission)\, there are two long-stan
 ding puzzles.  First: why are small X-ray groups so dim (or put another way
 \, why is the entropy of their gas so large)?  Second\, what prevents the g
 as from cooling and forming stars in "cool-core" clusters\, those clusters 
 that show gas cooling down to around 1 keV\, but no lower.  Data from the C
 handra X-ray telescope have convincingly provided part of the solution to t
 he second problem: energy input from AGN jets heats the gas when the gas te
 mperature drops too low.  However\, the nature of this thermostat is not we
 ll understood\, and I suggest a model which explains when and how gas can f
 uel the AGN.  Is the first puzzle also solved by AGN?  I will argue that th
 e correct answer is more closely tied to basic atomic properties of the gas
  than to black-hole physics.\n\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Title: "The Youngest Planets and Spots' Tricks"\n\nAbstract: A 
 correlation between the radial velocity variations and line bisector slope 
 changes in late-type stars implicates large starspots rather than a low-mas
 s companion.  Two young stars\, and recent results in the literature\, demo
 nstrate that the absence of this correlation is insufficient to rule out st
 arspots.  As part of our survey for substellar companions to T Tauri stars\
 , we identified the ~2 Myr old planet host candidates DN Tau and V836 Tau. 
 In both cases\, visible light radial velocity modulation appears periodic a
 nd is uncorrelated with line bisector span variations\, suggesting close co
 mpanions of several Jupiter masses in these systems.  However\, high-resolu
 tion\, infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that these radial velocity variat
 ions arise in starspots.  Observations of another young star\, V827 Tau\, a
 re unambiguous: it is identified as a spotted star on the basis of both vis
 ible light and infrared spectroscopy.  These results suggest that infrared 
 follow up observations are critical for determining the source of radial ve
 locity modulation in young\, spotted stars.  I will highlight recent observ
 ations of a promising ~2 Myr exoplanet host candidate which manifests a sim
 ilar radial velocity period and amplitude in both visible and infrared ligh
 t.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Age of B59 and the Pipe Nebula: Implications for the

 ratory for studying the earliest\nstages of star formation. Until recently 
 the Pipe had escaped detailed\nscrutiny despite its proximity (~130 pc) and
  size (~10^4 M_sun).\nRecent studies have suggested that the observed prope
 rties of dense\ncores in the Pipe may be difficult to reconcile with the mo
 re rapid\nevolution predicted by theories of turbulently driven star format
 ion.\nThermal pressure appears to provide the dominant source of support\na
 gainst collapse for these dense cores\, with non-thermal support\nconstrain
 ed to sub-sonic flows. These cores are also found to be\nstable\, with mini
 mum ages of 1 million years\, suggesting that they are\nevolving quasi-stat
 icly.\n\nUnderstanding the nature of this seeming conflict between observat
 ions\nand theory will be critical for clarifying our understanding of the\n
 star formation process.  To shed light on the age of the dense core\npopula
 tion in the Pipe\, I have made spectroscopic observations of the\nstellar c
 ontent of B59\, the most evolved core in the Pipe. Using these\nobservation
 s to place cluster members in the HR diagram\, I  have\nderived a relative

 ongoing to identify the full stellar content\nof the Pipe Nebula.  I will d

  the physics of star\nformation by comparing observations and theoretical p
 redictions in\nB59.

DESCRIPTION:Title: The Co-Evolution of Galaxies and Black Holes: A Local Pe
 rspective\n\nAbstract:  I will summarize recent investigations into the rel
 ation between the evolution of black holes and galaxies based on optical sp
 ectra and multi-color imaging of over 600\,000 galaxies provided by the Slo
 an Digital Sky Survey. These data are complemented by radio data from the V
 ery Large Array and vacuum ultraviolet images from the GALEX mission. I wil
 l show that the growth of supermassive black holes as traced by optically l
 uminous active galactic nuclei is strongly linked to the on-going formation
  of stars in the bulge component of galaxies. It is likely that this co-evo
 lution is driven by the accretion and radial transport of cold gas. Mergers
  of galaxies are only one way to drive this Flow. I will show that the char
 acteristic mass scales for the populations of growing black holes and bulge
 s are substantially lower now than in the past. The most massive black hole
 s are largely quiescent today with low-level activity driven by the slow ac
 cretion of hot halo gas and/or gas shed by evolved stars. The weak radio je
 ts such black holes produce nonetheless may play a key role in suppressing 
 star formation\, keeping their surrounding host galaxy "red and dead". Evid
 ence for galaxy-scale feedback in the form of powerful AGN-driven outflows 
 in the strongly accreting radio-quiet black holes is not clear. However\, f
 eedback from the massive stars whose formation seems to accompany the growt
 h of the black hole can be significant in these objects.\n

DESCRIPTION:White dwarfs represent the eventual end products of 98% of all 
 stars.  As such\, their luminosity and mass distributions can be used to un
 derstand the properties of their progenitor populations (e.g.\, the initial
  mass function of stars)\, and therefore feed directly into many interestin
 g astrophysical avenues.  In this talk\, I will summarize recent results fr
 om several observational campaigns to uncover these stellar cinders in a va
 riety of Galactic populations.  For example\, using some of the deepest HST
 /ACS imaging undertaken to date\, the faintest white dwarfs in nearby globu
 lar clusters have been detected and modeled to firmly establish the ages of
  the first structures to form in the Galactic disk and halo.  A similar sur
 vey of white dwarfs in rich open clusters\, covering a large range of age a
 nd metallicity\, has uncovered hundreds of these objects that are spectrosc
 opically accessible from Keck.  The follow up spectroscopic observations of
 \nthese stars has led to unprecedented constraints on one of the most funda
 mental relations in stellar astrophysics\, the initial-to-final mass relati
 on (i.e.\, what mass main-sequence star maps to white dwarf mass for M_init
 ial = 1 -- 7 Msun).  The results serve as a powerful calibrator of stellar 
 evolution models and as an important input to chemical evolution models of 
 galaxies including enrichment in the interstellar medium.  Extending these 
 results to extreme chemical environments\, we have used white dwarfs to she
 d light on a number of important astrophysical problems that I will discuss
 .  These include explaining the dearth of planets around white dwarfs\, the
  mass function of giants vs dwarfs in the Galactic bulge\, interpreting the
  UV-upturn from elliptical galaxies\, and possibly the different rates (and
  properties) of type Ia SNe in elliptical vs spiral galaxies.

DESCRIPTION:Allyson Sheffield -- Title: "Late-Type Giants as Probes of Gala
 ctic Structure"\n\nAbstract: \nHierarchical formation models predict that g
 alaxies form over time via the buildup of subgalactic fragments.  Relics of
  past accretion events would be manifested as kinematic substructures in a 
 galaxy.  Coherent streams wrapping around the Milky Way\, as well as other 
 nearby galaxies\, have indeed been detected\, lending strong support to the
  hierarchical formation paradigm. During a merger or accretion event\, star
 s will be mixed\, but the signature of the disruption of a satellite will b
 e preserved in phase space.  Stars deriving from a common progenitor should
  have similarities in their chemical abundance patterns\, trends that are d
 irectly correlated to the details of their enrichment history.  Therefore\,
  studies of the kinematics and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Wa
 y\, in particular old stars found in the thick disk and halo components\, c
 an help to unravel the mystery of its formation.  I will review the excitin
 g progress in this field and report the findings from an ongoing survey aim
 ed at exploring the chemodynamical history of the Milky Way.\n

DESCRIPTION:Title: Black-Hole Binaries As Sources Of Long-Soft Gamma-Ray Bu
 rst And Hypernova Explosions\n\nThe Collapsar model\, in which a fast-spinn
 ing massive star collapses into a Kerr black hole\, has become the \nstanda
 rd model to explain long-soft gamma-ray bursts and hypernova explosions (GR
 B/HN)\, however\, stars \nmassive enough (those with ZAMS mass larger than 
 some 18 to 20 solar masses) to produce these events \nevolve through a path
  that loses too much angular momentum as to produce a central engine capabl
 e of \ndelivering the necessary energy.  In this work we study the soft X-r
 ay transient sources as the remnants of \nGRBs/HNe\; that is\, binaries in 
 which\, as the massive primary star evolves a carbon-oxygen burning core\, 
 it \nstarts transferring material to the secondary star (Case C mass transf
 er)\, shrinking the orbit until a \ncommon-envelope evolution sets in and t
 he secondary spirals in\, further narrowing the orbit of the binary and \nr
 emoving the hydrogen envelope of the primary star\; eventually the primary 
 star becomes tidally locked and gets \nspun up acquiring enough rotational 
 energy to power up a GRB/HN explosion.  The central engine producing the \n
 GRB/HN event being the Kerr black hole through the Blandford-Znajek mechani
 sm.\n\nIt turns out that our model can explain not only the long-soft GRBs\
 , but also:  The subluminous bursts\, which \ncomprise about 97% of the tot
 al\, the bursts of cosmological energy and the short-hard bursts (in a neut
 ron star\, \nblack hole merger).  Because of our binary evolution through C
 ase C mass transfer\, it turns out that for the \nsubluminous and cosmologi
 cal bursts\, the angular momentum is proportional to the mass of the second
 ary star \nto the 3/2 power.  This gives the binary evolution a great advan
 tage over the Woosley Collapsar model\; namely\, \nthat one can ``dial" the
  donor mass in order to achieve whatever angular momentum is needed to driv
 e the \nexplosion.\n\nPopulation syntheses show that there are enough binar
 ies to account for the progenitors of all classes of GRBs.\n

DESCRIPTION:Abstract:\n\nM dwarfs are the smallest stars in the Galaxy that
  can still fuse hydrogen.  They can be 10 times less massive\, twice as coo
 l and over 1000 times dimmer than the Sun.  Yet despite their diminutive ph
 ysical properties\, M dwarfs make up ~75% of all of the stars in the Milky 
 Way and have main sequence lifetimes that exceed trillions of years .  Thei
 r dominance in the Galaxy make M dwarfs excellent tracers of both the struc
 ture and evolution of the local Milky Way.  In addition\, these little star
 s have intense stellar flares and strong magnetic fields that allow us to p
 robe their interiors and may have important consequences for the habitabili
 ty of planets that orbit them.  Current astronomical surveys have allowed a
 stronomers to construct samples that contain millions of M dwarfs - more th
 an those for any other type of star.\n\nI will present results from several
  M dwarf studies that have come out of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) 
 and represent the largest photometric and spectroscopic M dwarf samples eve
 r assembled (35 million and 50\,000 stars respectively).  Specifically\, I 
 will highlight work that has used the unprecedented statistical power of SD
 SS to examine the structure and kinematics of M dwarfs in the Milky Way as 
 well as the serendipitous nature of survey science.  These results in turn 
 have led to improved stellar luminosity and mass functions\, accurate activ
 ity-age relations for low-mass stars\, information about the kinematic\, me
 tallicity and binary evolution of the Milky Way thin disk\, the rate  of st
 ellar flares\, the identification of stars with large space motions and low
  metallicities\, and constraints on the magnetic dynamo mechanism in fully 
 convective stellar interiors.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Title: Magnetic Fields in Evolved Stars\n\nAbstract:  Observati

 post-main sequence evolution for low-mass stars (< 8 M_sun).  This talk wil
 l highlight the possible consequence of magnetic fields on (1) chemical pro
 cessing during the RGB/AGB phases and (2) outflow shaping during the post-A
 GB phase.  \n\nFor RGB/AGB stars\, isotopic abundance measurements require 
 that extensive\, slow mixing transports material from the hydrogen-burning 
 shell to the convective envelope (so called Cool Bottom Processing).  Buoya
 nt magnetic flux tubes in the stellar interior may supply the necessary CBP
  transport rates to match observations.  \n\nFor post-AGB stars\, the trans
 ition to bipolarity requires strong magnetic fields to power the outflows. 
  For the magnetic field to be dynamically important\, an additional source 
 of angular momentum must be tapped\, likely via a binary interaction. \n\n

DESCRIPTION:Title: Planets and Dynamical Dominance: History and Prospects\n
 \nAbstract: \nSince the time of Copernicus\, the number of objects called â
 planetsâ has changed along with our understanding of the architecture of th
 e solar system. Former âplanetsâ include the Sun\, Moon\, the first 15 know
 n asteroids\, and Pluto.\n\nThe IAU definition of a planet as a heliocentri
 c body that âhas cleared the neighborhood around its orbitâ is problematic.
  Clearance is never complete because the asteroid and comet reservoirs are 
 leaky\, and resonant planet-crossing orbits can be stable. A more accurate 
 criterion for planetary status is âdynamical dominanceâ. An object is dynam
 ically dominant if it sweeps up or scatters other objects from its orbital 
 zone in a time much less than the age of the system (theoretical criterion)
 \, and/or if its mass is much greater than the total mass of all other obje
 cts in its orbital zone (observational criterion)\, where âorbital zoneâ ca
 n also be simply quantified.\n\nThe eight planets in the solar system dynam
 ically dominate all other heliocentric objects by orders of magnitude. Whet
 her a comparable gap exists in other planetary systems remains to be seen. 
 \n\nNumerical experiments suggest that our solar system is dynamically full
 \, with almost no room left to insert another planet in a stable orbit betw
 een the existing ones. Dynamical studies of other planetary systems suggest
  that this may be a general rule. The âpacked planetary systemâ hypothesis 
 of Raymond and Barnes recently led to the successful prediction of a planet
  (HD 74156d)\, the first since the discovery of Neptune in 1846. It suggest
 s that other systems may also contain a distinct set of planets that dynami
 cally dominate swarms of smaller objects. \n\n

 re many of the physical characteristics of\nnon-relativistic YSO jets\, whi
 le displaying phenomena typically\nassociated with relativistic XRB jets\, 
 they provide a bridge between\nnon-relativistic and relativistic collimated

 with jets from\nWDs are observationally accessible. Jets from WDs may thus

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: The gas between the stars in our galaxy fundamentally
  affects how our galaxy\, the Milky Way\, behaves.   It provides the materi
 al from which new stars form\, absorbs the material cast off of massive sta
 rs when they die\, and stores material for the creation of future stars.  N
 ot only does gas permeate the galaxy's disk\, where most of the galaxy's st
 ars are found\, but it also resides above the disk\, in the galaxy's halo. 
   Observations reveal that much of the gas in the halo is extremely hot (T 
 ~ a million degrees K).  Heating large quantities of gas to such high tempe
 ratures requires\nextremely large energy sources.    Thus\, the hot gas tha
 t we see now can be treated as a tracer of extremely energetic events that 
 occurred in our galaxy's past.    It is a window into the Milky Way's histo
 ry and behavior.  However\, our galaxy is capable of creating hot gas by ma
 ny means\, so astronomers must determine which types of events heated the g
 as in the halo.  The most well known explanation is that clustered supernov
 a explosions energize gas in the disk and that this gas later expands into 
 the halo.   However\, individual supernova explosions and infalling interga
 lactic gas could also be important.  In this talk\, I will discuss the obse
 rved characteristics of the hot gas in the halo and will relate these chara
 cteristics to the types of events that may have heated the gas in our galax
 y.\n

 ng detector to validate the invariance of c to motion of the observer - a n
 ecessary condition for the local Lorentz invariance of c - which can now on
 ly be inferred from a combination of indirect evidence and symmetry argumen
 ts.  We briefly summarize the present status of tests of special relativity
  in the photon sector\, discuss the errors\, misconceptions and conventiona
 l wisdom that confuse the issue\, and suggest two definitive experiments th
 at could resolve it.  We have recently performed one of them\, a direct mea
 surement of c with a moving detector by lunar laser ranging.  Predictable o
 bjections to this kind of measurement are addressed\, and our approach to a
 nalyzing the data is discussed.  If c is ultimately found to be independent
  of the velocity of the moving observer it would be an important validation
  of special relativity.  But if c is found to vary with the velocity of the
  observatory along the line-of-sight it would be a first-order violation of
  local Lorentz invariance and allow for the possibility that a preferred re
 ference frame exists\, an idea that most physicists (other than perhaps som
 e contemporary field theorists) would be quite reluctant to accept.\n

DESCRIPTION:"The Precessing Circumbinary\, Protoplanetary Disk surrounding 
 KH 15D"\n\nKH 15D is a binary T Tauri star surrounded by a warped\, precess
 ing circumbinary disk or ring with a characteristic radius of about 3 AU an
 d inner edge near 0.6 AU.  The combined mass of the stars is about 1.3 sola
 r masses and the age is about 3 Myr. The system may\, therefore\, be releva
 nt to studies of the earliest stages of planet formation in the Solar Syste
 m. The disk appears to be in transition between the more primitive state of
  a typical classical T Tauri star accretion disk and the more evolved state
  of a debris disk (e.g. Beta Pic). In particular there is evidence for grai
 n growth to perhaps chondrule (mm) size. The unusual geometry of the system
  and orbital motion of the stars with respect to the disk is providing a we
 alth of detail on spatial scales smaller than a solar radius. I will descri
 be the current state of knowledge of this unique and important object. \n\n

 of their stellar mass after z = 1 (with a scatter to higher value)\, while 
 their less luminous (M(V ) > -21) counterparts form 30-60% of their mass in

 n SALT are SALTICAM and\nthe Robbie Stobbie Spectrograph (RSS) and by far\,
  the majority of the\nearly science produced by SALT will be from these two
  instruments.\nThese instruments provide a range of observing modes\, inclu
 ding\nFabry-Perot imaging\, polarimetry\, and high speed photometry.  Due t
 o\nthe large user community\, resources available\, and unique observations
 \nmodes of SALT\, the development of reduction and analysis software is\nke
 y to maximizing the scientific return of the telescope.  We describe\nthe c
 urrent efforts at SAAO to develop PySALT\, a set of tools for the\nreductio
 ns and analysis of SALT data.  PySALT is developed in the\nPython/PyRAF env
 ironment and takes advantage of the large library of\nopen-source astronomi
 cal software.  The goals in the development of\nPySALT are: (1) Provide sci
 ence quality reductions for the major\noperational modes of SALT\, (2) Crea
 te analysis tools for the unique\nmodes of SALT\, and (3) Create a framewor
 k for the archiving and\ndistribution of SALT data. The benefits in develop
 ing PySALT are\nhighlighted through early results from high-speed photometr

DESCRIPTION:The Richness and Beauty of the Physics of Cosmological\nRecombi
 nation\n\nABSTRACT: The physical ingredients to describe the epoch of\ncosm
 ological recombination are amazingly simple and well-understood.\nThis fact
  allows us to take into account a very large variety of\nprocesses\, still 
 finding potentially measurable consequences. In this\ntalk we highlight som
 e of the detailed physics that were recently\nstudied in connection with co
 smological hydrogen and helium\nrecombination. The impact of these consider
 ations is two-fold: (I) the\nassociated release of photons during this epoc
 h leads to interesting\nand unique deviations of the Cosmic Microwave Backg
 round (CMB) energy\nspectrum from a perfect blackbody\, which\, in particul
 ar at cm and\ndecimeter wavelength\, may become observable in the near futu
 re.\nObserving the spectral distortions from the epochs of hydrogen and\nhe
 lium recombination\, in principle would provide an additional way to\ndeter
 mine some of the key parameters of the Universe (e.g. the\nspecific entropy
 \, the CMB monopole temperature and the pre-stellar\nabundance of helium. (
 II) This spectral features will be strongly\namplified or change their shap
 e in the case of the early energy\nrelease in the Universe due to\, for exa
 mple\, particle decay or\nannihilation. (III) with the advent of high preci
 sion CMB data\, a very\naccurate theoretical understanding of the ionizatio
 n history of the\nUniverse becomes necessary for the interpretation of the 
 CMB\ntemperature and polarization anisotropies. Here we show that the\nunce
 rtainty in the ionization history due to several processes\, which\nuntil n
 ow were not taken in to account in the standard recombination\ncode RECFAST
 \, exceed the level of 0.1% to 0.5%. However\, it is indeed\nsurprising how
  inert the cosmological recombination history is even at\npercent-level acc
 uracy.\n\nPlease call the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at (212
 )\n992-8780 for more information.\n\nA reception will be held at NYU's Cent
 er for Cosmology and Particle\nPhysics\, 5th Floor Lounge\, Meyer Hall of P

DESCRIPTION:Up and Over the Iron Peak: Heavy Metals in Planetary Nebulae\n\
 n\nThe chemical composition of a planetary nebula is determined by a combin
 ation of the initial composition of its progenitor star and the cumulative 
 effects of nuclear processing within the star during its evolution. We usua
 lly think of He and the CNO group as being the main elements whose abundanc
 es are revised by the low and intermediate mass stars that produce planetar
 y nebulae. However\, some of these stars also experience slow neutron captu
 re reactions that create trans-iron nuclei\, followed by convective mixing 
 that carries the products upward into the layers that are expelled when the
  nebula is created. I will describe recent work\, by my collaborators and m
 yself\, demonstrating that several light trans-iron elements\, Ge\, Se\, an
 d Kr (atomic numbers 32\, 34\, and 36) are enriched by up to an order to ma
 gnitude or more in a significant fraction of Milky Way and Local Group plan
 etary nebulae. I will also discuss a novel method for determining the abund
 ance of iron in the progenitor stars using Zn (element 30) as a surrogate\,
  which sheds new light on the initial composition and population membership
  of the parent stars.\n

 r have been mostly around relatively nearby and \nbright stars. As a result
 \, the host stars are mostly (i) in the Galactic disk\, (ii) relatively \nm
 assive\, and (iii) relatively metal rich. After a review of the current sta
 tus of exoplanets\, \nI will describe the SWEEPS project which was aimed at
  extending our \nknowledge to stars which (i) are in a different part of th
 e Galaxy\, (ii) have low masses\, and \n(iii) have a large range of metalli
 cities.  We used the Hubble Space Telescope to monitor \n180\,000 F\, G\, K
 \, and M dwarfs in the Galactic bulge continuously for 7 days in order to \
 nlook for transiting planets. We discovered 16 candidate transiting extraso
 lar planets with \nperiods of 0.6 to 4.2 days\, including a new class of ul
 tra-short period planets (USPPs) with \nP <1 day. Radial velocity observati
 ons of two brightest candidates support the planetary \nnature. These resul
 ts suggest that planets are equally abundant in the Galactic bulge and \nar
 ound low-mass stars\, and the metallicity distribution holds even for the s
 tars in the \nGalactic bulge. The USPPs occur only around low-mass stars wh
 ich may suggest that \nclose-in planets around higher-mass stars are irradi
 ately evaporated. \n

DESCRIPTION:Type Ia Supernova Explosions: From Deflagration to Detonation\n
 \nType Ia Supernovae are one class of bright stellar explosions that are di
 stinguished by a lack of hydrogen in the observed spectra. The most widely 
 accepted scenario is a thermonuclear runaway occurring in a C/O white dwarf
  that has gained mass from a main-sequence companion.\nI will present resul
 ts from a study of the the explosion mechanism that is in progress at the A
 SC Flash Center at the University of Chicago.\nIn these simulations\, ignit
 ion of the nuclear burning occurs slightly off-center\, and the subsequent 
 evolution of the nuclear burning is surprisingly asymmetric with a growing 
 bubble of hot ash rapidly rising to the stellar surface. Carrying the evolu
 tion further\, we find htat as the bubble breaks out\, the bubble laterally
  accelerates fuel-rich outer stellar layers. This material remains confined
  to the stellar surface and races around the star\, focusing at the opposit
 e side and igniting a detonation just above the surface of the star. I will
  present simulations demonstrating this gravitationally confined detonation
  scenario and discuss its implications for the observed diversity of Type I
 a supernovae.

DESCRIPTION:Large-Scale Gravitational Instability and Star Formation in the
  Large\nMagellanic Cloud\n\nLarge-scale star formation in disk galaxies is 
 hypothesized to be driven\nby global gravitational instability. The observe
 d gas surface density is\ncommonly used to compute the strength of gravitat
 ional instability\, but\naccording to this criterion star formation often a
 ppears to occur in\ngravitationally stable regions. One possible reason is 
 that the stellar\ncontribution to the instability has been neglected. We ha
 ve examined the\ngravitational instability of the Large Magellanic Cloud (L
 MC) considering\nthe gas alone\, and considering the combination of collisi
 onal gas and\ncollisionless stars. We compare the gravitationally unstable 
 regions with\nthe on-going star formation revealed by Spitzer observations 
 of young\nstellar objects. Although only 62% of the massive young stellar o
 bject\ncandidates are in regions where the gas alone is unstable\, some 85%
  lie\nin regions unstable due to the combination of gas and stars. The comb
 ined\nstability analysis better describes where star formation occurs. In\n
 agreement with other observations and numerical models\, a small fraction\n
 of the star formation occurs in regions with gravitational stability\nparam
 eter Q > 1. We further measure the dependence of the star formation\ntimesc
 ale on the strength of gravitational instability\, and\nquantitatively comp
 are it to the exponential dependence expected from\nnumerical simulations.\

DESCRIPTION:Are M Dwarfs Good Targets for Planet Finding and Do We Care?\n\
 nHere I illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of focusing different t
 ypes of planet searches on M dwarfs. Ideally\, these stars are good targets
  for both radial velocity (RV) and astrometry targets since their reduced m
 ass results in larger signals\, however\, they have not been the focus of t
 he original long term RV programs due to their being faint and associated w
 ith large photospheric variability.  Since observing techniques have mature
 d\, there are now both radial velocity and astrometric programs devoted to 
 searching to planets with three RV planetary systems discovered to date and
  the first astrometrically detected planet around an M dwarf soon to come. 
  Those planets around M dwarfs have some of the lowest masses discovered to
  date (<10Mearth sini).  The fact that M dwarfs are faint makes them ideal 
 targets for both transit and direct imaging programs due improved contrast 
 levels between the star and planet.  Larger telescopes and improvements in 
 high contrast and imaging capabilities are making M dwarfs more viable targ
 ets for direct imaging and transit surveys.  It is believed that a dedicate
 d transit M dwarf survey could result in the detection of superEarths.  The
  observed frequency of planets around M dwarfs can distinguish core accreti

DESCRIPTION:Dynamical evolution of rotating globular clusters with embedded
  black holes\n\nEvolution of self-gravitating rotating dense stellar system
 s (e.g. globular clusters) with embedded black holes is investigated. The i
 nterplay between velocity diffusion due to relaxation and black hole star a
 ccretion is followed together with cluster differential rotation using 2D+1
  Fokker Planck and direct NBody models models. The models can reproduce the
  Bahcall-Wolf f ~ E^1/4 (rho ~ r^?7/4) cusp inside the zone of influence of
  the black hole. Angular momentum transport and star accretion processes su
 pport the development of central rotation in relaxation time scales\, befor
 e re-expansion and cluster dissolution. Gravogyro and gravothermal instabil
 ities conduce the system to a faster evolution leading to shorter collapse 
 times.\n\n

  extraordinary\nsupernova explosions. Among these is SN2006gy\, which radia
 ted more\nluminous energy than any other supernova.  It may be our first\no
 bserved case of a so-called &quot\;pair instability supernova&quot\;\, thou
 ght to\nmark the deaths of the first stars in the very early Universe\n(alt
 hough SN2006gy was relatively nearby)\, and it appears to have\nsuffered a 
 violent precursor mass ejection just 5-10 years before the\nSN.  It was pro
 bably the most massive star ever seen to explode\, and I\nwill mention conn
 ections to one of the most massive stars in our own\nMilky Way galaxy\, cal
 led Eta Carinae.  SN2006gy is one of a class of\nsupernovae that are plowin
 g into very dense circumstellar matter\nejected by the star in the decade o
 r so preceding the final SN.\nAnother example I will mention is SN2006jc\, 
 which was actually\nobserved to have this type of eruption just 2 years bef
 ore it exploded\n(the only such example so far).  I will discuss how this e
 pisodic\npre-supernova mass loss\, combined with some other recent clues\, 
 is\nforcing us to revise some of our fundamental paradigms of massive star\
 nevolution.\n

  Solar Nebula\nconditions. Indeed\, since comets at least partially consist
  of  \npresolar\nmaterial\, they offer the opportunity for direct study of 
 material\nformed in the interstellar medium or around evolved stars as well
 .\n\nThis talk reviews methods used for measuring the masses and\nbulk dens
 ities of comet nuclei\, through observations from ground\nand by spacecraft
 \, as well as through theoretical modeling. In  \nparticular\,\nthe non-gra
 vitational force modeling technique is discussed\, where\norbit changes cau

DESCRIPTION:Forming the Red Sequence in Massive Galaxy Clusters\n\nAbstract
 : The oldest and most massive galaxies in the universe are in\nclusters.  H
 owever\, we still do not understand how the passive\nearly-type galaxies th
 at define the red sequence form: In the\nframework of hierarchical assembly
 \, we expect massive galaxies to\nevolve from mergers at late times\, yet t
 he bulk of past observations\ndo not support this scenario.  Only by pairin
 g extensive ground-based\nspectroscopic surveys with imaging from the Hubbl
 e Space Telescope can\nwe resolve this conflict.  I summarize results from 
 our\nmulti-wavelength studies of galaxies in clusters at 0.37<z<0.83 that\n
 provide direct evidence for the formation of massive early-type\ngalaxies v
 ia dissipationless merging.  Combining our results with\nstudies at lower r
 edshifts enables us to better trace the lineage of\nearly-type galaxies in 
 nearby clusters such as Coma.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Emily Alicea-MuÃ±oz (Penn State/NASA Goddard)\n\nIntense structu
 re formation and reionization dominate the first\n  billion years of the un
 iverse. Thus it is important to quantify\n  these processes through physica
 l models in order to interpret the\n  sparsely available data in this epoch
 . Essential clues about this\n  critical era will come from the rate and pr
 operties of the mergers\n  of massive black holes (MBHs). These are expecte
 d to be bright\n  sources of gravitational radiation\, detectable by space-
 based\n  gravitational wave detectors such as LISA. Past efforts have been\
 n  limited to calculating merger rates using different models in which\n  m
 any assumptions are made about the specific values of physical\n  parameter
 s of the mergers\, resulting in merger rate estimates that\n  span a very w
 ide range ( 0.1 - 10^4 mergers/year). We will develop\n  a semi-analytical\
 , phenomenological model that includes plausible\n  combinations of several
  physical parameters involved in the\n  mergers\, which we will turn around
  to determine how well LISA\n  observations will be able to enhance our und
 erstanding of the\n  universe during the critical z ~ 5 - 30 structure form
 ation era. We\n  do this by generating synthetic LISA data from our model f
 amilies\,\n  which we analyze using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. This
 \n  allows us to constrain the physical parameters using merger rates\,\n  
 masses\, and redshifts derived from LISA observations.

  Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE)\nprogram\, is
  a massive imaging and spectroscopy survey\, carried out as part\nof the ex
 tension to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II). As a subset\nof the\nSEG
 UE experiment\, we have been systematically targeting nearby "M\nsubdwarfs"
 \,\nwhich are the oldest stars in the vicinity of the Sun. These relatively
 \nrare objects\nare identified in large numbers in the AMNH-SUPERBLINK all-
 sky survey of\nstars with large proper motions. Kinematics and abundance me
 asurements for\na large\, unprecedented number of these unassuming old\, fa

 \n\nGlobular clusters are among the oldest stellar populations in the local
  Universe\, thus providing a unique window onto the earliest epochs of\n ga
 laxy formation.  As markers of the most intense periods of star\n formation
 \, these old\, massive star clusters are intricately entwined with\n the fo
 rmation of the galaxies that host them.  Some of their properties\,\n but n
 ot all\, mirror those of their host galaxies\, and it is from both the\n si
 milarities and differences that we can gain insights on galaxy\n evolution.
   I will present a view of globular cluster systems in 100\n early-type gal
 axies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey\, the most\n comprehensive and homo
 geneous data set of its type to date.  I will\n describe some of the main r
 esults of the survey\, including the\n metallicities\, specific frequencies
 \, and spatial density profiles of our\n surveyed globular cluster systems\
 , and discuss their implications for\n early galaxy formation.

 o N-body simulations of collapsing clouds of\nboulders into rubble piles.\n

 ion. For the first time we treat the problem by 3D radiation\nhydro simulat
 ions. We find the formation of a hot bubble around the\nyoung planet rather

 ype one migration and in some cases\neven reversed\, leading to an at least
  temporary outward drift\nof a 10 Mearth planet.

DESCRIPTION:Benne Holwerda (STScI)\n\nThe number of distant galaxies seen t
 hrough a foreground spiral is indicative of this spiral disk's interstellar
  dust extinction. To calibrate for crowding and confusion effects\, Gonzale
 z et al. (1998) developed the ``Synthetic Field Method''. I have automated 
 this method and I applied it to 32 archival HST/WFPC2 images. Several radia
 l opacity profiles from the combined counts are presented\; averaged over t
 he entire sample or for arm and disk regions. We have found that extinction
  in a spiral galaxy extends at least to its optical radius and appears cons
 tant for a large part of the disk. \n\nThe opacity of the disk can be compa
 red to the stellar density or HI column density. We find that the brighter 
 parts of a spiral disk -the arms and the center- are more opaque than the r
 est of the disk. There is a relation between surface brightness and dust op
 acity\, especially in the spiral arms. There appears little relation betwee
 n HI column density and opacity radial profiles. The ratio between the aver
 aged HI and opacity profiles does indicate more dust to HI than previous wo
 rk. \n\nSpitzer observations are rapidly characterizing the spatial and tem
 perature components of the dust in spiral disks. A direct comparisons betwe
 en the Spitzer observations and the measured opacity of some of these disks
 \, provides us insight in the dust geometry. The opacity is mainly due to c
 old (T<25 K) dust in the disk\, grouped in small\, optically thin clouds.\n
 \nThe "Synthetic Field Method" and its limitations are now very well charac
 terized. The HST/ACS imaging in the archive on M51. M101 and M81 are the op
 timal datasets for distant galaxy counts to provide new information on inte
 rstellar dust in spiral disks.

DESCRIPTION:Jeff Oishi (AMNH)\n\nDynamical migration of protoplanets seems 
 likely to explain\nthe observed distribution of extrasolar planets. Previou
 s work on\nlaminar disks predicts short migration times (less than the disk
 \nlifetime). This is a significant problem for the "core accretion"\nscenar
 io\, in which giant planets are thought to form from small\,\nrocky protopl
 anetary cores in the disk. However\, there have been\nrecent suggestions th
 at the turbulence providing accretion in\nprotoplanetary disks might enhanc
 e migration by turning laminar\nmigration into a random walk\, possibly pro
 viding a solution to the\nshort migration timescale.\n\nI will report the r
 esults of local\, 3D simulations of MHD turbulence\nwith quiescent "dead zo
 nes" of varying sizes at the midplane. I\ndemonstrate that turbulent torque
 s on a massless protoplanet at the\nmidplane are strongly affected by the p
 resence of dead zones\, which\nconsiderably decrease the total turbulent to
 rque on the planet. In\nall cases\, the torques have a finite correlation t
 ime and are\ndominated by gas close to the planet. These results can be\nin
 corporated into statistical models for the survival of a population\nof pro
 toplanets in a disk\, allowing a better understanding of the\nnature of pla
 net migration and survival.

DESCRIPTION:Kevin Heng (U. Colorado/APS/JILA)\n\nI summarize past and prese

 orado). New (2004 July) G750L and G140L Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograp
 h (STIS) data of the HÎ± and LyÎ± emission from SNR 1987A are presented (Heng
  et al. 2006). Reverse shock emission\, in both HÎ± and LyÎ±\, appears to com
 e in two flavors and with comparable intensities: surface (from debris at t
 he shock front) and interior (from debris beneath the surface). Large syste
 matic uncertainties prevent us from discerning between the two limiting beh
 aviours of the HÎ± flux â self-similar expansion and halting of the reverse 
 shock. Such a determination is important for constraining the rate of hydro
 gen atoms crossing the shock\, which is relevant to the question of whether
  the reverse shock emission will vanish in\n7 years (Smith et al. 2005). I 
 next present a new formalism to describe the ratios and profiles of emissio
 n lines from hydrogen in Balmer-dominated shocks\, which are used to interp
 ret the measured widths and ratios of broad and narrow HÎ±\, HÎ² and LyÎ± emis
 sion lines in SNRs (Heng & McCray 2006). Our model results agree fairly wel
 l with those obtained previously by Chevalier\, Kirshner & Raymond (1980) a
 nd are consistent with observations of several SNRs. The same model fails t
 o account for the ratio of broad to narrow line emission from the reverse s
 hock in SNR 1987A as observed by Heng et al. (2006). We suggest that this d
 iscrepancy between theory and observation results from a faulty assumption 
 that Balmer-dominated shocks can be treated as sharp discontinuities.\n

 e reduction\nand large-scale wind clumping.  Initial results indicate that 
 O star\nmass-loss rates must be significantly lower than has commonly been\
 nsupposed\, whereas there is little evidence for large-scale clumping and\n
 the associated wind porosity.  A subset of hot stars show x-ray emission\nl

 rotating toroids and infall motions. In this talk\, I will show you two of 
 the best cases of the detection of rotating toroids around O type stars\, f
 or which high-angular resolution observations have allowed us to study in d

DESCRIPTION:Tony Moffat (U. Montreal)\n\nLocating the most massive stars an
 d measuring their masses is key to understanding the formation and nature o
 f massive stars in general. This is best done by using the least model-depe
 ndent technique\, i.e. Keplerâs laws (combined with techniques to extract t
 he orbital inclination) for binary systems that contain very luminous stars
  on or near the main sequence\, where interaction effects are not (yet) imp
 ortant. In the local Universe\, it appears that the potentially most massiv
 e\, main-sequence stars are the most luminous hydrogen-rich WR stars of typ
 e WN5-7ha\, which are even more luminous than\, and probably at least as ho
 t as\, the recently recognized hottest main-sequence stars of type O2. WN5-
 7ha stars exhibit strong\, broad WR-like emission lines because of their hi
 gh luminosity\, not because of their compactness and high ratio of L/M as c
 lassical He-burning WR stars. It is probably no coincidence that the curren
 tly most massive stars measured this way are in WR20a\, an eclipsing binary
  system containing two identical WN6ha stars of 83 and 82 solar masses. Oth
 er WN5-7ha stars\, some even more luminous (and thus more massive) than WR2
 0a\, are being measured currently and I will report on the overall results\
 , with implications for stellar evolution.

 at has prevailed for many\nyears is misleading\, and time-dependent phenome
 na may hold the key to an understanding of the way young stars grow and the
 ir circumstellar\nenvironments evolve.\n

DESCRIPTION:Stephen Murray (Harvard-CfA)\n\nX-ray observations of the unive
 rse provide an important channel for our understanding of the makeup of the
  cosmos. Virtually all celestial objects radiate in X-rays\, and most of th
 e baryonic mass of the universe primarily glows in X-ray emission. Since it
 s launch in July 1999\, the Chandra X-ray Observatory has returned a wealth
  of data on the X-ray sky. I will describe this NASA Great Observatory and 
 discuss the technical advances that Chandra has brought to the field. Durin
 g its first seven years of operation Chandra has provided many interesting 
 science results. I will give some examples of these discoveries\, particula
 rly in observations of Supernova Remnants\, Pulsars\, Active Galaxies and L
 arge Scale Structure.

DESCRIPTION:Brian O'Shea (LANL)\n\nI use the cosmological adaptive mesh ref
 inement code Enzo\nto do a suite of high-resolution numerical simulations o
 f Population\nIII protostellar clouds in a cosmological context.  These\nca
 lculations examine the formation of primordial protostellar clouds\nat a ra
 nge of redshifts and in differing cosmic "neighborhoods."  I\nfind that the
 se cores have a wide variety of accretion rates -\nvarying by over two orde
 rs of magnitude - which may have significant\nimplications for the IMF of P
 opulation III stars.  I then simulate\nsupernovae from the inferred stellar
  mass range and follow the\nevolution of the ensuing supernova remnant unti
 l the deposition of\nmetal-enriched gas in the next generation of halos\, w
 hich generally\noccurs ~50 million years after the original supernova. The 
 dense gas\nin the core of these "child" halos is typically enriched to\nmet
 allicities of ~10^-3 solar\, which is above the "critical\nmetallicity" at 
 which metal line cooling dominates over molecular\ncooling\, and suggests t
 hat the stars in these halos will have a\nsignificantly lower mass range th
 an their Population III parents.\nThis metal enrichment is a local phenomen
 on\, and the transition of\nthe universe from primordial to metal-enriched 
 gas will be quite\nextended.

DESCRIPTION:Ed Moran (Wesleyan)\n\nInvestigations of the high-redshift X-ra
 y galaxies detected in the\nChandra Deep Fields have suggested the existenc
 e of new populations\nof X-ray-luminous objects that are absent or rare in 
 the local\nuniverse.  By simulating how nearby active galaxies would appear
  if\nobserved as part of the CDFs\, we gain insight into the nature of\nsup
 ermassive black holes and their environments at earlier epochs and\nthe ext
 ent to which X-ray galaxies have evolved with cosmic time.\n

 today.  But what caused the Big Bang in the first place?  Could it be that 
 what we think of as the moment of creation was simply part of an infinite c
 ycle of titanic collisions between our Universe and another one?\n\n
